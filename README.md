# Canopy: Insights for Farmers

Canopy is a project developed during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 to assist the agricultural community in water-related environmental decision-making. By integrating satellite data, geospatial datasets, and AI-driven insights, Canopy simplifies complex information into actionable insights for farmers.

---

## Problem Statement
The agricultural community faces significant challenges due to water-related environmental factors such as groundwater levels, floods, runoff, and temperature fluctuations. Farmers require reliable and easy-to-understand tools to:

- Analyze long-term environmental trends.
- Make informed decisions regarding water management and farming practices.
- Adopt sustainable practices like organic farming effectively.

---

## Our Approach
We designed Canopy to be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution by focusing on three key pillars:

1. **Data Integration and Processing:**
    - Utilizing NASA's satellite and geospatial datasets.
    - Aggregating 10 years of data on groundwater, runoff, floods, and temperature trends.
    
2. **Interactive Visualization:**
    - Developing interactive graphs to display comparisons and trends.
    - Presenting insights in an intuitive manner, tailored for farmers' understanding.

3. **AI-Powered Assistance:**
    - Using AI to summarize insights from data visualizations.
    - Implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to provide expert guidance on organic farming best practices.

## Features

### 1. Data Processing and Analysis
- Processed and analyzed a decade's worth of environmental data to identify key patterns and trends.
- Focused on the aggregation and comparison of max, min, and mean values across 52 weeks for:
  - Groundwater
  - Runoff
  - Floods
  - Temperature

### 2. Interactive Visualization
- Designed interactive and easy-to-understand graphs to:
  - Highlight historical comparisons.
  - Present trends in water availability, temperature, and other critical metrics.

### 3. AI-Driven Insights
- Used AI models to summarize results derived from the interactive visualizations.
- Developed an AI RAG chatbot capable of:
  - Answering user queries on agricultural best practices.
  - Providing detailed guidance on adopting sustainable and organic farming techniques.
