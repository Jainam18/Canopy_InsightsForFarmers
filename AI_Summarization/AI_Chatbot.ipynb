INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nOrganic agriculture is an integrated production management system which promotes and enhances \\nagro -ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity (FAO/WHO \\nCodex Alimentarius Commission, 2007). It emphasizes the use of natural inputs (i.e. mineral and \\nproducts derived from plants) and the renunciation of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.  \\nOrganic agriculture follows the principles and logic of a living organism, in which all elements (soil, \\nplant, farm animals, insects, the farmer and local conditions) are closely linked to each other. This is \\naccomplished by using, where possible, agronomic, biological and mechanical methods, following the \\nprinciples of these interactions, using natural ecosystem as a model (Figure 1).  \\n \\nFIGURE 1-1 - USING NATURAL ECOSYST EM AS A MODEL  \\nOrganic agriculture share s many techniques used by other sustainable agricultural approaches (e.g. \\nintercropping, crop rotation, mulching, integration of crops and livestock). However, the use of natural \\ninputs (non synthetic), the improvement of soil structure  and fertility  and the use of a crop rotation \\nplan represent the basic rules that make organic agriculture a unique agricultural management system.  \\nAccording with the Guidelines of Organically Food Produce of the Codex Alimentarius  (2007) , an \\norganic production system is designed to:  \\n\\uf0b7 Enhance biological diversity within the whole system;  \\n\\uf0b7 Increase soil biological activity;  \\n\\uf0b7 Maintain long -term soil fertility;  \\n\\uf0b7 Recycle wastes of plant and animal origin in order to  return nutrients to the soil, thus minimizing \\nthe use of non -renewable resources;  \\n\\uf0b7 Rely on renewable resources in locally organized agricultural systems;  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote the healthy use of soil, water and air as well as minimize all forms of pollution that may \\nresult from agricultural practices;  \\n\\uf0b7 Promote the careful processing methods agricultural products in order to maintain the organic \\nintegrity and vital qualities of the product at all stages;  \\n\\uf0b7 Become established on any existing farm through a period of conversio n, the appropriate length \\nof which is determined by site -specific factors such as the history of the land, and type of crops \\nand livestock to be produced.  \\n \\nIn addition, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), a non -\\ngovernment al organization internationally networking and promoting organic agriculture, has \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='7 \\n \\n established guidelines that have been widely adopted by the organic community for organic \\nproduction and processing.  \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1-2 - OVERVIEW OF ORGANIC P RODUCTION IN 2003:  HECTARES UNDER CERTIF IED ORGANIC MANAGEME NT IN THE DIFFERENT \\nCONTINENT (SOURCE : SOEL  STATISTIC , 2003)  \\nAccording with IFOAM  (2002) , the organic agriculture practices are based on the following principles:  \\n\\uf0b7 Prin ciple of health : the role of organic a griculture, whether in farming, processing, \\ndistribution, or consumption, is to sustain and enhance the health of ecosystems and \\norganisms from the smallest in the soil to human beings. In view of this , it should avoid  the \\nuse of fertilizers, pesticides, animal drugs and food additives that may have adverse health \\neffects.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Principle of e cology : organic a griculture should be based on living ecological systems and \\ncycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain ing them. Organic management must \\nbe adapted to local conditions, ecology, culture and scale. The reduction of inputs by reuse, \\nrecycl e and the efficient management of materials and  energy will contribute to  improve \\nenvironmental quality and will conserve res ources.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Principle of f airness : This principle emp hasizes that those involved in organic a griculture \\nshould conduct human relationships in a manner that ensures fairness at all levels and to all \\nparties – farmers, workers, processors, distributors, trader s and consumers. It also insists that \\nanimals should be provided with the conditions and opportunities of life according with their \\nphysiology, natural behaviour and well -being. Natural and environmental resources that are \\nused for production and consumpti on should be managed in a socially and ecologically fair \\nway and should be held in trust for future generations. Fairness requires systems of \\nproduction, distribution and trade that are open and equitable and account for real \\nenvironmental and social costs . \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Principle of Care : This principle states that precaution and responsibility are the key \\nconcerns in management, develop ment and technology choices in organic a griculture.

But what does \\nsustainability mean? In the context of agriculture, sustainability refers to the successful management \\nof agricultural resources to satisfy human needs while at the same time maintaining or enhancing the \\nquality of the environment and conserving natural resources  for future generations . Sustainability in \\norganic farming must therefore be seen in a holistic sense, which incl udes ecological , economic and \\nsocial aspects.  \\n \\nFIGURE 1-3 - THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY  \\nOnly if the three dimensions are fulfilled an agricultural system can be called sustainable . \\nThe organic ag riculture techniques are known to be  by: \\n\\uf0b7 Improving soil structure and fertility through the use of crop rotations, organic manure, mulches  \\nand the use of fodder legumes for adding nitrogen to the soil fertility cycle.   \\n\\uf0b7 Prevention o f soil erosion and compaction by protecting the soil planting m ixed and relay crops.  \\n\\uf0b7 Promotion of  biological diversity through the use of natural pest controls (e.g. biological control, \\nplants with pest control properties) rather than synthetic pesticides  which, when misused, are \\nknown to kill beneficial organisms (e.g. natural parasites of pests, bees, earthworms), cause pest \\nresistance, and often pollute water and land.  \\n\\uf0b7 Performing c rop rotations , which  encourage a diversity of food crops , fodder and und er-utilized \\nplants; this, in addition to improving overall farm production and fertility , may assist the on -\\nfarm conservation of plant genetic resources . \\n\\uf0b7 Recycling the nutrients by using crop residues (straws, stovers and other non -edible parts) \\neither dir ectly as compost and mulch or through livestock as farmyard manure.  \\n\\uf0b7 Using renewable energies, by i ntegration of livestock, tree crops and on farm forestry into the \\nsystem . This  adds income through organic meat, eggs and dairy products, as well as draught \\nanimal power. Tree crops and on -farm forestry integrated into the system provide food, income,  \\nfuel and wood.  \\n \\nSustainability is also about equity among and between generations. Organic agriculture contributes to \\nthe social well -being by reducing the losses of arable soil, water contamination, biodiversity erosion, \\nGHG emissions, food losses , and pesticide poisoning.   \\nOrganic agriculture is based on traditional knowledge and culture. Its farming methods evolve to \\nmatch local environ ments, responding to unique biophysical and socio economics constraints and \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='9 \\n \\n opportunities. By using local resources, local knowledge, connecting farmers, consumers and their \\nmarkets, the economic conditions and the development of rural can be improved.  \\nOrganic agriculture stresses diversification and adaptive management to increase farm productivity, \\ndecrease vulnerability to weather vagaries, and consequently improves food security, either with the \\nfood the farmers produce or the income from the products t hey sell.  \\nOrgan ic farming appears to generate 3 0% more employment in rural areas and labor achieves higher \\nreturns per unit of labor input. By using local resources better, organic agriculture facilitates \\nsmallholders ’ access to ma rkets and thus income generation; and relocalizes food producti on in \\nmarket -marginalized areas.  \\nGenerally, organic yields are 20% less as compared to high -input systems in developed countries but \\ncould be up to 180% higher as compared to low -input systems in arid/semi -arid areas. In humid areas, \\nrice paddy yields are equal, while the productivity of the main crop is reduced for perennials, though \\nagroforestry provides additional goods.  \\nOperating costs (seeds, rent, repairs and labor) in organic agriculture are significantly lower than \\nconventional production, ranging from 50 -60% for cereals and legumes, to 20 -25% for dairy cows and \\n10-20% for horticulture products. This is due to lower input costs on synthetic inputs, lower irrigation \\ncosts, and labor cash c osts that include both family labor and hired workers. Total costs are, however, \\nonly slightly lower than conventional, as fixed costs (such as land, buildings and machinery) increase \\ndue to new inve stments during conversion (e.g.  new orchards, animal hous es) and certification.  \\nThe demand for organic products creates new export opportunities. O rganic exports are sold at \\nimpressive premi ums, often at prices 20% higher than the same  products produced on non -organic \\nfarms. Under  the right circumstances the market returns from organic agriculture can potentially \\ncontribute to local food security by increasing family incomes.  \\nEntering this lucrative market is not easy. Farmers require hiring an organic certification organization \\nto annually i nspect and confirm that the ir farms and businesses adhere to the organic standards \\nestablished by various trading partners . During the conversion period to organic management, which \\nlasts 2 to 3 years, farmers cannot sell their produce as “organic” and thu s, tap price premiums. This is \\nbecause consumers expect organic produce to be free of residues. However, according to the Codex \\nGuidelines  on Organically Produced Food (2007) , products produced on land under organic \\nmanagement for at least one year , but le ss than the two -three year  requirement could  be sold as \\n“transition to  organic ”; but very few  markets have developed for such products.

Produce is used by farmers for their own consumption  or it is sold  on the market  \\nwithout a price dis tinction as it is not certified.  \\nEconomic objectives are not the only motivation of organic farmers; the goals are often to optimize \\nland, animal and plant interactions, preserve natural nutrient and energy flows and enhance \\nbiodiversity, while safeguardi ng human health of family farmers and contributing to the overall \\nobjective of sustainable agriculture.   \\nIFOAM. 2003.

CONSIDERATI ONS FOR CONVERSION  \\nTO ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\n \\n \\nThe conversion from a conventional to an organic system requires a transitory period, where the \\norganic practices are applied progressively following an organized plan. During this per iod it is \\nimportant to analyse carefully the actual situation of the farm and identify the actions to be taken \\n(Florez, 2003).  \\nThe analysis of the farm must include  (Figure 2 -1): \\n1. Farm characteristics: size, plots and crops distribution, which kind of crop s, trees, animals are \\nintegrated in the farm system.  \\n2. Soil Analysis: an evaluation of the soil structure, nutrient levels, organic matter content, \\nerosion level, and/or the soil have been contaminated.  \\n3. Climate: rainfall distribution and quantity, temperatur es, frost risks, humidity.  \\n4. Organic matter sources and management (manures).  \\n5. Presence of animal housing systems and/or machinery.  \\n6. Limiting factors such as capital, labour, market access, among others.  \\nThis information will help you to have a clear picture o f your farm and to take decisions.  \\n  \\nConversion to organic agriculture describes the process of learning and implementation of c hanges on \\nthe farm towards a more  sustainable and natural way of farming. The form the process takes depends \\non the local circumstances and the predisposition of the farmer or the community, a nd it varies from \\nfarm to farm. The more knowledge a farmer has about the co ncepts and practices of organic farming, \\nthe easier conversion  process  to o rganic farming will be.  Even if organic farming does not depend on \\nspecific land con ditions to start with, if soils are depleted for example, it may need greater ef forts  and \\nrequire more patience to establish a sustainable production system and realize satisfying harvests.  \\nHere, you will find the factors to be considered during conversion to organic agriculture and some \\nrecommendations to succeed during the process.  \\nSUMM ARY  \\nFIGURE 2-1 - PREPARING FOR THE CON VERSION  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='12 \\n \\n  \\nDepending on the farm situation, different challenges are to be expected during  conversion:  \\n 1.FARMS WITH HIGH EXTER NAL INPUT USE  \\nThe majority of intensively managed farms in Africa , Latin America and Asia that strongly rely on \\nexternal inputs are larger farms. Such farms mostly grow a f ew annual or perennial cash crops relying \\nheavily on the use of fertili zers for plant nutrition and pes ticides and herbicides for pest, disease and \\nweed control. On such farms crops are often grown without a planned rotation and farm animals are \\nnot integrated into the nutrient cycle. Diversification is usuall y low on these farms. Trees and bushes \\nare mostly removed to facilitate extensi ve mechanization , and crops are mostly grown alone.  (Figure \\n2-2). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPotential challenges in conversion of such farms  (Figure 2 -3): \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing a diverse and balanced farming system with a natural ability to  regulate itself \\nusually takes several years.  \\n\\uf0b7 Major ef forts may be necessary to restore natural soil fertility by providing a  considerable \\namount of organic matter to the soil.  \\n\\uf0b7 Abandoning high input external fertilizers results in yield depression in the  first years of \\nconversion, before soil fertility is re -established and yields rise  again.  \\n\\uf0b7 New approaches and practices usually involve a lot of learning and intensive  observation of \\ncrop development, and dynamics of pests, diseases and natural  enemies.  \\nFIGURE 2-2 - CONVERSION OF A HIGH EXTERNAL INPUT FARM  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='13 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 2-3 - MINIMIZING EXTERNAL I NPUT  \\nHowever, the conversion process can be achieved, if the following practices are implemented:  \\n\\uf0b7 Diversify the farming system : Select appropriate annual crops for the area  and rotate them \\nin a planned sequence. Include legume cro ps such as beans  or leguminous feed crops in the \\nrotation to provide nitrogen to the subsequent  crops. Plant hedges and flower strips to \\nencourage natural enemies  and to control pests.  \\n\\uf0b7 Start recycling valuable farm by -products . Establish on -farm compost pr oduction  based on \\nharvest residues and manure, if available, and mix the  compost with the topsoil. This will bring \\nstable organic matter into the soil  and improve its structure and its capacity to feed the plants \\nand store water.  Green manures can provide plenty of plant material to feed soil organisms  \\nand build up soil fertility  (Figure 2 -4). \\n\\uf0b7 Introduce farm animals into the system . Farm animals provide valuable manure  and \\ndiversify farm income through additional animal products.  \\n\\uf0b7 Grow cover crops . Cover cro ps or lay out mulches in perennial crops provide  protection to the \\nsoil. \\n \\nFIGURE 2-4 - RECYCLING VALUABLE FA RM BY -PRODUCTS  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='14 \\n \\n  2.FARM WITH LOW EXTERNA L INPUT USE  \\nFarmers working with little external inputs bas ed o n traditional practices may grow many different \\ncrops in a densely mixed s ystem on the same piece of land changing crops randomly. A few livestock \\nsuch as chickens, pigs, cattle and/or goats may be kept, which scatter the manure in their feeding \\nplac es, he nce providing very little manure for the gardens. The trees may be extensively cut for \\nfirewood and  charcoal burning. Bush and trash burning may be a common practise especially during \\nland preparation.  Harvests are probably low and increasingly becoming di fficult due to unreliable and \\ninsufficient  rains. The harvests may just be sufficient fo r feeding the family and little may be left to sell \\nfor income.  (Figure 2 -5). \\n \\nFIGURE 2-5 - CONVERSION OF A LOW E XTERNA L INPUT FARM  \\nTraditional farmers fulfil some principles of org anic farming already by relying on farm -own resources, \\ngrowing different crops si multaneously and raising livestock . However, there are still practices, which \\nclearly distinguish such farms fr om organic farms. The following challenges need to be addressed for \\nconversion:  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid burning of crop residues after harvest as this is, in most cases, not a  viable solution, \\nsince it destroys valuable organic material and damages soil  organisms.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish a  well organised diversification systems including a ‘planned’ crop rotation and \\nintercropping systems.  \\n\\uf0b7 Accumulate knowledge and practice regarding efficient use of farm own resources,  especially \\nfor compost production to manage and improve soil fertility.  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid i ndiscriminate tree cutting for firewood and charcoal burning.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish a system to collect the animal manure for composting.  \\n\\uf0b7 Apply measures to prevent loss of soil through erosion and protect it from  drying out.  \\n\\uf0b7 Pay special attention to satisfy fee d and health requirements of the farm animals.  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid infection of seeds with diseases, gain knowledge on disease cycles and  preventive \\nmeasures.  \\n\\uf0b7 Avoid harvest and storage losses.  \\n \\nSome practices for conversion in this system  are (Figure 2 -6): \\n\\uf0b7 Implement pl anned crop rotation and intercropping systems. A combination of annual and \\nperennial crops including leguminous green manure cover crops is needed. Combined with \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='15 \\n \\n properly selected or improved crop varieties with good resistance to plant pests and diseases,  \\nwill facilitate the crop and soil management . \\n\\uf0b7 Proper integration of a nimals into the farming system, as well as p lanting rows of nitrogen \\nfixing trees between annual crops will improve the growing conditions for the crops and \\nencourage better growth, whil e providing additional feed for the ruminant animals. Better \\nhousing is also needed to facilitate collection of animal manure for field use.  \\n\\uf0b7 Improving the fertility of the soils, for example, through the application of high quality compost. \\nCompost is a hi ghly valuable fertilizer in organic farming. Instead of burning the crop residues \\nafter harvest, collect them for compost production, or work them into the soil. The animal \\nmanures and plant materials should be regularly collected for compost making.  \\n\\uf0b7 Growi ng nitrogen fixing legumes between annual crops is another possibility to feed the soil \\nand the crops.  \\n\\uf0b7 Additional measures to control soil erosion such as digging trenches and planting trees along \\nthe hillside, and covering the soil with living or dead pla nt material should be implemented.  \\n \\nFIGURE 2-6 - SOME ORGANIC FARMING METHODS TO TEST IN Y OUR OWN FARM  \\n 3.MIXED F ARM  \\nOn mixed farms, crops and farm animals may be  integrated, whereby the animal manure is collec ted \\nand used in the gardens after  having kept it for a few weeks to rot. Some soil conservation measures \\nmay b e implemented, such as mulching in perennial crops and trenches to reduce er osion. \\nOccasionally herbicides, pesticides and treated seeds may be us ed to control weeds in fruit and \\nvegetable  production.  Farmers of such mixed farms are obviously fa miliar with some of the organic \\nfarming practices. Such farmers will find it easy to learn new methods from other f armers or from a \\ntrainer and to implement organic practices throug hout the farm.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='16 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 2-7 - CONVERSION OF A MIXED  FARM  \\nRecommendation s for organic conversion  (Figure 2 -7): \\n\\uf0b7 Implement organic practices to manage the soil and to control weeds inste ad of using \\nherbicides. For example, in fruit orchards grow a leguminous cover  crop to cover the soil. Or in \\nvegetables and arable crops implement a planned  crop rotation that includes weed \\nsuppressing green manure or feed crops.  \\n\\uf0b7 Further improve recycling of farm own nutrients from animals and crop residues  to make best \\nuses of them, for example by mixing them with crop residues  for making compost. Improve \\nstorage of animal manures to avoid nutrient  losses.  \\n\\uf0b7 Use seeds without pesticide -treatments, if availab le. Make sure to use healthy  seeds only and \\nget familiar with non -chemical ways of treating seeds.  \\n\\uf0b7 Get familiar with approaches and methods of natural pest and disease control.  \\n\\uf0b7 Learn about beneficial insects and observe population dynamics of pests  through  regular \\nmonitoring during crop growth.  \\n\\uf0b7 Further diversify the farming system to increase productivity of the land and  provide habitats \\nfor beneficial insects and spiders.  \\n 4.DEGRADED L AND \\nLand may be degraded due to shifting cultivation , overgrazing, over -cultivation or deforestation, \\nsalinity after years of intensiv e irrigation with ground water, or water logging and flooding. Such land \\nmay t ake more effort and patience to establish good growing conditions. At the same  time, organic \\npractices are an excellent  approach to recover such soils. It may req uire specific practices to stop soil \\ndegradation and to re -establish soil fertility.  Such practices include digging of terraces or sowing an \\nintensive fallow with  a leguminous green manure crop that grows well on poor soils. (Figure 2 -8).  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='17 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 2-8 - CONVERSION OF DEGRADE D LAND  \\nMany experiences show that organic far ming is a promising approach to improve degraded land and \\nbring it back into producti on. In most cas es, the increase of organic matter plays a key role to improve \\nthe quality of degraded soils.  \\nIn case of a bare and eroded soil  on sloping land, or ganic farming calls for digging of terraces (e.g. \\nfanya juu terraces , see the figure below ). Fanya juu (‘thro w it upwards’  in Kiswahili) terraces are made \\nby digging trenches along the contou rs and throwing the soil uphill to form embankments (bunds), \\nwhich are stabilize d with fodder grass like Napier (Pennisentum purpureum) and multipurpos e \\nagroforestry trees (F igure 2 -9). The space between the embankments is cultivated with cro ps and over \\ntime, the fanya juu develop into bench terraces. They are useful in semi -arid area s to harvest and \\nconserve water. Additionally, green manures and  compost can be used to furthe r build the soil to \\nsuppo rt good crop growth and yields.  \\nSaline soils  contain large amounts of water soluble salts that inhibit seed germination and plant \\ngrowth. These salts ma y have been accumulated through excessive use of irrigation water, especially \\nin ari d and semi -arid climates. These salts can be reduced slowly by ensuring proper  irrigation and \\nbuilding up the structure of the soil with compost to allow natura l drainage of the excess salts. In a \\nfirst period salt tolerant crops may be grown.  \\nAcid s oils can be reclaimed by adding lime and well -made compost.  \\nFlooded soils  can be improved by creating drainage channels to drain off the excess  water.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='18 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 2-9 - FANYA -JUU T ERRACES TECHNIQUES O F KENYA  \\n \\nConverting a farm to organic farming in an area wit h very little rainfall and high temperatures or \\nstrong winds will be more cha llenging than converting a farm located in an area with well distributed \\nrainfall and fav ourable temperatures.

STEP BY STEP CONVERSION  \\nTO ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nThe procedure of conversion of a farm commonly consists of three steps. In a first  step, it is \\nrecommended to collect information  on appropriate organic farming practices. In a second step, the \\nmost promising organic prac tices should be tried out on selected plots or fields to get familiar with . In \\na third step, only organic procedures sho uld be implemented in the entire fa rm. Support from an \\nexperienced extension officer or a farmer is usually very helpful to give guidanc e in the process . \\n \\nFIGURE 3-1 - HOW TO BECOME AN ORGA NIC FARMER ? \\n \\nSuccessful organic farming requires considerable knowledge on the functioning and the possibilities of \\nmanagement of natural processes. Interest in learning about the possibilities to support natural \\nprocesses to sustain and improv e harvests is essential for successful organic farming. Farmers who are \\ninterested in adopting organic farming practices are recommended to get in contact with farmers in \\nthe area  (Figure 3 -1), who already practice organic farming to learn from them. Some farmers may be \\ngood at making compost, some at growing green manures, and some at making plant or manure tea. \\nLearning from experienced farmers allows to get first -hand experience under local conditions, and \\nthus to learn about the advantages and potential  challenges related to implementing organic methods.  \\n(Figure 3 -2). \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='21 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 3-2 - HOW TO GET INFORMATIO N ON ORGANIC AGRICUL TURE ? \\nBasically, farmers who are interested in converting their farm to organic agric ulture  need to know:  \\n\\uf0d8 How to improve soil fertility.  \\n\\uf0d8 How to keep crops healthy.  \\n\\uf0d8 How to best increase diversity in the farm.  \\n\\uf0d8 How to keep livestock healthy.  \\n\\uf0d8 How to give value to organic products and how to successfully sell them.  \\n \\nAfter having collected information about the requirements, the potentials and the main practices \\nrelated to conversion, farmers should start to learn from their own experience on  their farms. To \\nminimize risks of crop failure and losse s of animals, and avoid frustrating overload, farmers are \\nrecommended to implement organic practices step -by-step to a limited extent, selecting specific \\npractices at a time and testing them on selected plots or selected animals only. But which practices \\nshould one choose to start with? As would seem natural,  farmers should start by applying practices \\nthat are of low risk and investment, require little specific knowledge, limited additional labour, and \\nwith high short term impact. Examples of rec ommended in terventions include (Figure 3 -3): \\n\\uf0d8 Mulching - Covering the soil with dead plant material is an easy way to control weeds and \\nprotect the soil in annual crops. This practice can be implemented into most existing cropping systems. \\nThe main question may be, ho wever, where to get appropriate plant material from.  \\n\\uf0d8 Intercropping  - Growing two annual crops together, commonly a leguminous crop like beans \\nor a green manure crop in alternating rows with maize or another cereal crop or vegetable is a \\ncommon practice in organic farming to diversify production and maximize benefits from the land. In \\nintercropping, special attention must be paid to avoid competition between the crops for light, \\nnutrients and water. This requires knowledge on arrangements, which promote grow th of at least one \\nof the crops.  \\n\\uf0d8 Composting - Application of compost to the fields can have a major impact on crop growth and \\nyields. To start compost production, farmers will need enough plant materials and animal manures, if \\nsuch are available. In case s uch materials are scarce, farmers would first have to start producing plant \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='22 \\n \\n materials on the farm by sowing fast growing leguminous plants that build a lot of biomass, and by \\nintroducing some livestock on the farm for manure production, if this proves appr opriate. To get \\nfamiliar with the process of making compost, farmers should be instructed by an experienced person. \\nProper compost production requires some knowledge and experience and additional labor, but is low \\nin investments.  \\n\\uf0d8  Green manuring  - The prac tice of growing a leguminous plant species for biomass production \\nand incorporation into the soil may be new to most farmers. Nevertheless, this practice can greatly \\ncontribute to improvemen t of soil  fertility. Green manures can be grown as improved fallow s, as \\nseasonal green manures in rotation with other crops, or in strips between crops. Proper green \\nmanuring first requires information on appropriate species.  \\n\\uf0d8 Organic pest management – Careful associations and management of plants and animals in \\norder to prevent pest and disease outbreaks. Initially, bio -control agents may be applied but organic \\npest management is best achieved through ecological approaches that establish a pest/predator \\nbalance. While the choice of resistant varieties of crops is paramoun t, other prevention methods \\ninclude: choosing sowing times that prevent pest outbreaks; improving soil health to resist soil \\npathogens; rotating crops; encouraging natural biological agents for control of disease, insects and \\nweeds; using physical barriers  for protection from insects, birds and animals; modifying habitat to \\nencourage pollinators and natural enemies; and trapping pests in pheromone attractants.    \\n\\uf0d8 Appropriate seeds and planting material  - Use of healthy seeds and planting materials, and \\nrobu st and/or improved cultivars can make a big change in crop production. This practice may require \\nsome information on selection of seeds and planting materials including availability of improved \\nvarieties and seed treatments. Generally, locally -adapted seed s are preferred because of their \\nresilience to local conditions.  \\n\\uf0d8 Planting of leguminous trees  - In perennial crop plantations such as banana, coffee or cocoa, \\nplanting of leguminous trees such as gliricidia, calliandra , and sesbania  may improve the growing  \\nconditions of the fruit crop by providing shade, mulching material and nitrogen through nitrogen \\nfixation. In addition, some leguminous trees provide good fodder for livestock. This practice requires \\nsome knowledge on shade and space requirements of the t ree crops and thus on ideal planting \\npatterns for the leguminous trees.  \\n\\uf0d8 Growing farm -own animal feeds  - To improve available feeds for the livestock, farmers may \\ngrow grasses and leguminous fodder crops around, between other crops or in rotation. As animal  feed \\nmust be of organic origin, feed sources are best addressed by considering farm grown feed.  \\n\\uf0d8 Terraces and soil bunds  - Construction of terraces and soil bunds along the curves of hills is a \\nkey measure for soil conservation. This practice builds the fo undation of further improvement to soil \\nfertility on slopes. It is of high relevance, but requires much labor and some specific knowledge for \\nappropriate implementation.

Rather, the focus is on choosing crops that can easily be integrated into the exist ing farming \\nsystem and will contribute to its improvement. But the choice also depends on the farmer’s knowledge \\non the right management of the crops, their contribution to a diverse family diet or their demand in \\nthe market. Besides growing crops for food , farmers may need to grow leguminous cover crops to \\nprovide high -protein feed for livestock and to be used as green manures to feed the soil. Planting trees \\nfor shade, as windbreak, for firewood, feed, mulching material or for other uses, can be recommend ed \\nin most situations.  \\n \\nCriteria for crop selection during conversion  (Figure 3 -4): \\na. In the first place, organic farmers should grow enough food for the family. But they may also \\nwant to grow crops for the market to get money for other family needs. The far mers should \\nalso grow crops that contribute to improvement of soil fertility. Farmers who keep livestock \\nneed to grow pasture grass and legumes.  \\n \\nb. Basically, farmers should select crops with low risk of failure. Cereals and legumes  such as \\nmaize, sorghum, millet, beans and peas  are especially suitable for conversion, since they \\ncost little to produce, generally have moderate nutrient demands and are robust against pests \\nand diseases. In addition, many of the traditional crops can be stored and sold in domes tic \\nmarkets. High -value short term  crops , such as most vegetables , are more delicate to grow \\nand highly susceptible to pest and disease attack. Therefore, they should not be grown on a \\nlarger scale, unless the farmer can sustain some losses in harvest.  \\n \\nc. The crops to grow for sale should include crops that can be sold at the farm gate, at the \\nroadside market or can be transported directly to nearby markets in urban centres. Choosing \\nthe right crop to sell on the market may require some market information. De cision making for \\ncrops for local or export markets requires detailed information from traders or exporters on \\nthe crops, requested varieties, quantities, qualities, regularity and season.  \\n \\nd.  High -value perennial  crops such as fruit trees  take at least 3 ye ars until the first harvest \\nfrom the date of planting. This makes them appropriate crops for the conversion period. For \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='24 \\n \\n new plantations, species and varieties must be carefully selected to suit the organic market and \\nproduction requirements. For conversion  of an existing orchard, it might be necessary to \\nreplace old existing varieties, if they are very susceptible to diseases and the product quality \\ndoes not match with the market requirements.  \\n \\ne. The success of a crop will also depend on provision of favourab le growing conditions. The \\nbetter a crop variety matches local soil and climate conditions, and is tolerant or resistant to \\ncommon pests and diseases, the better it will grow.  \\n \\nf.  Planting of hedges  other crops and/or agroforestry trees can be valuable to he lp establish a \\ndiverse farming system.  \\n \\ng. Growing leguminous green manures  provides nutrients to the soil. Green manures do not \\nprovide immediate income, but in the long -term, they make the soil fertile and productive for \\nthe future.  \\n \\nFIGURE 3-4 - WHICH CROPS SHOULD I GROW ? \\nMany farmers want to see quick results and often ask how long it takes for organic crops to grow. \\nOrganic farming does not aim to make crops grow faster. Crops will grow faster and larger wh en they \\nhave better growing conditions than before. Although conventionally grown crops can be made to \\ngrow faster by intensive use of synthetic fertilizers and sprays. Organic crops are nurtured to grow at \\ntheir normal, natural rate in order to be less su sceptible to pests and diseases and build up good \\nphysical and nutritional structure. However, organic  farmers do a lot to make their crops grow healthy \\nand to produce good yields.  \\n \\n \\nIn a third step, implementation  of organic practices throughout the entire farm  should be considered, \\nonce sufficient experience with different practices has  been gained. As soon as organic practices are \\nimplemented throughout the entire  farm, a farmer can claim to be an organic farmer.   \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='25 \\n \\n Commonly, consistent application of organic practices marks the beginning  of a long process of \\nimproving the production system:  \\n1. Improving soil fertility  based on the recycling of farm own organic materials and \\nenhancement  of farm own biomass production.  \\n2. Encouraging positive interactions  between all parts of the production system (the farm \\necosystem) to enhance self -regulation of pests and diseases.  \\n3. Optimizing the balance between feed production and livestock . \\nFarming organically also means continuously l earning from personal observation,  from outside \\nexperiences, sharing experiences with other organic farmers  and implementing new information on \\nthe your farm, making it increasingly  more sustainable.  \\n \\na) Pesticides:  \\nOrganic  farm ers are responsible to protect the organic fields from being sprayed with synthetic \\npesticides  (Figure 3 -5). Even if the neighbour is not farming organically, an organic farmer can grow \\norganic foods and fibres. To avoid pesticide drift from neighbouring f ields onto the crops, organic \\nfarmers should safeguard the organic fields by using any of the following measures:  \\n\\uf0d8 Planting of natural hedges  on the boundary to neighbouring fields can avoid the risk of \\npesticide spray drift through wind or run -off water. T he wider the border area around the \\nfields, the better.  \\n\\uf0d8 To avoid runoff from upstream fields, organic farmers should divert the water away or talk to \\nthe farmers upstream about how to work together to minimize the risk of contamination \\nthrough water. Organ ic farmers, who are interested in saving nature, should share their \\nknowledge and experiences with neighbours with the aim of helping them to either adopt \\norganic farming practices or to minimize the risk of contaminating nature.  \\n \\nFIGURE 3-5 - HOW TO PROTECT CROPS FROM PESTICIDE DRIFT ? \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='26 \\n \\n b) Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO):  \\nGenetically modified seeds and planting materials are produced by transferring isolated genes from \\nplants, animals or microorganisms int o the crop genome, by using methods different from pollination \\nand crossing natural barriers. Genetically modified products should, therefore, not be used in \\norganic farming, and organic farmers should protect their production against any GMO \\ncontamination  (Figure 3 -6).  \\nHowever, with the increased use of GM crops in the conventional farming systems, the risk of GMO \\ncontamination is expected to increase. Species which cross -pollinate, such as rapeseed or maize, or \\ninsect pollinated crops, such as soybean or  cotton, are at a higher risk of being contaminated by a \\nnearby genetically modified crop. Species that are mainly vegetative pollinated such as potatoes, \\ncassava or banana are at lower risk of GMO contamination. Besides the genetic contamination, there is  \\nalso a risk of physical contamination caused by GMO residues along the production and market chain, \\nif GMO and organic products are not properly separated during storage and transportation.  \\n \\nFIGURE 3-6 - HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK  OF GMO  CONTAMINATION ? \\nRecommendations to farmers for reducing the GMO contamination risk:  \\n\\uf0d8 Use either personally selected seeds or get organic or untreated seeds. Verify the origin of the \\nseeds, making sure that they do not come from ne ighbouring farmers where GM crops are \\ngrown, or from farms surrounded by GM crops (minimum distance of at least 1 km).  \\n\\uf0d8 If you use seeds from a trader, make sure that they are registered and can confirm where the \\nseed is derived from. Check that he is not involved in GM production and multiplication. Ask \\nyour trader for a certificate confirming GM free seeds and inquire about the trader’s \\ninvolvement in the GM -seed market.  \\n\\uf0d8 Check for the breeding habits of the specific crops you are interested in. Most cross  breeding \\nspecies such as maize can disperse by wind or bees to distances of up to 1 to 3 km.  \\n\\uf0d8 Seeds of some crops can survive for 5 to 20 years in the soil. Therefore, precautions must be \\ntaken that no GM crops have been planted on land that shall be used for organic production.  \\n\\uf0d8 Create protective safety (buffer) zones around your fields to reduce the risk of GMO pollen \\ndispersal, if GM crops are cultivated in this region. Isolation distances between GM crops and \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='27 \\n \\n organic fields should be established, about 2 -3 times larger than those required for seed \\nproduction for a given species. For dispersal of critical GM crops such as maize, the isolation \\ndistance should probably not be less than 2 to 3 km. This will reduce GMO dispersal by pollen \\nto a great extent. Fo r wind pollinated crops, like maize, borders or hedges with taller plant \\nspecies, such as sugarcane or trees, can additionally prevent cross -pollination with GM crops.  \\n\\uf0d8  Avoid any physical GM contamination by using sowing and harvesting machines, transporte rs, \\nprocessing and storage facilities not used by GM farmers. In case you have to use the same \\nmachines, thorough cleaning is necessary. Do not store organic products next to GM products.  \\n\\uf0d8 GMO free regions should be encouraged wherever possible, especially for own seed production.  \\n \\nFiBL (2011): African Organic Agriculture Training Manual – Conversion.

MULCHING IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nMulching is the process of covering the topsoil with plant  material such as leaves, grass, twigs, crop \\nresidues, straw etc. A mulch cover enhances the activity of soil organisms such as earthworms. They \\nhelp to create a soil structure with plenty of smaller and larger pores through which rainwater can \\neasily infi ltrate into the soil, thus reducing surface runoff. As the mulch material decomposes, it \\nincreases the content of organic matter in the soil.  Soil organic matter helps to create a good soil with \\nstable crumb structure. Thus the soil particles will not be easily carried away by water. Therefore, \\nmulching plays a crucial role in preventing soil erosion.  \\nIn some places, materials such as plastic sheets or even stones are used for covering the soil. However, \\nin organic agriculture the term ‘mulching’ refers on ly to the use of organic, degradable plant materials.  \\n(FIGURE 4-1)\\n\\uf0d8 Protecting the soil from wind and water erosion: soil particles cannot be washed or blown \\naway.  \\n\\uf0d8 Improving the infiltration of rain and irrigation water by maintaining a goo d soil structure: no \\ncrust is formed, the pores are kept open  \\n\\uf0d8 Keeping the soil moist by reducing evaporation: plants need less irrigation or can use the \\navailable rain more efficiently in dry areas or seasons  \\n\\uf0d8 Feeding and protecting soil organisms: organic mulch material is an excellent food for soil \\norganisms and provides suitable conditions for their growth  \\n\\uf0d8 Suppressing weed growth: with a sufficient mulch layer, weeds will find it difficult to grow \\nthrough it  \\n\\uf0d8 Preventing the soil from heating up too much: m ulch provides shade to the soil and the \\nretained moisture keeps it cool  \\n\\uf0d8 Providing nutrients to the crops: while decomposing, organic mulch material continuously \\nreleases its nutrients, thus fertilizing the soil  \\n\\uf0d8 Increasing the content of soil organic matter : part of the mulch material will be trans -formed to \\nhumus  SUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='29 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 4-1 - SKETCH ON THE EFFECTS  OF MULCHING  \\nThe kind of material used for mulching will greatly influence its effec t. Material which easily \\ndecomposes will protect the soil only for a rather short time but will provide nutrients to the crops \\nwhile decomposing. Hardy materials will decompose more slowly and therefore cover the soil for a \\nlonger time. If the decompositio n of the mulch material should be accelerated, organic manures such \\nas animal dung may be spread on top of the mulch, thus increasing the  nitrogen content  (Figure 4 -2). \\n \\nFIGURE 4-2 - OPTIMISING NITROGEN C YCL ING IN THE FARM .  \\nSCHEME OF A FARM WITH  FIELDS AND ANIMALS S HOWING INPUTS , OUTPUTS AND LOSSES  \\nWhere soil erosion is a problem , slowly decomposing mulch material (low nitrogen content, high \\nC/N) will provide a long -term protection compared to quickly decomp osing material.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='30 \\n \\n \\uf0b7 Weeds or cover crops  \\n\\uf0b7 Crop residues  \\n\\uf0b7 Grass  \\n\\uf0b7 Pruning material from trees  \\n\\uf0b7 Cuttings from hedges  \\n\\uf0b7 Wastes from agricultural processing or from forestry  \\nWhile mulch ing has a lot of advantages, it can also cause problems in specific situations:  \\n\\uf0d8 Some organisms can proliferate too much in the moist and protected conditions of the mulch \\nlayer. Slugs and snails can multiply very quickly under a mulch layer. Ants or termit es which \\nmay cause damage to the crops also may find ideal conditions for living.  \\n\\uf0d8 When crop residues are used for mulching, in some cases there is an increased risk of \\nsustaining pests and diseases. Damaging organisms such as stem borers may survive in the  \\nstalks of crops like cotton, corn or sugar cane. Plant material infected with viral or fungal \\ndiseases should not be used if there is a risk that the disease might spread to the next crop. \\nCrop rotation is very important to overcome these risks.  \\n\\uf0d8 When carb on rich materials such as straw or stalks are used for mulching, nitrogen from the \\nsoil may be used by microorganisms for decomposing the material. Thus, nitrogen may be \\ntemporary not available for plant growth.  \\n\\uf0d8 The major constraint for mulching usually is  the availability of organic material. Its production \\nor collection usually involves labour and may compete with the production of crops.  \\n \\nFIGURE 4-3 - POTENTIAL PROBLEMS RE LATED TO MULCHING (PHOTO OF A MULC H LAYER ) \\nIf possible, the mulch should be applied before or at the onset of the rainy season, as then the soil is \\nmost vulnerable.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='31 \\n \\n If the layer of mulch is not too thick, seeds or seedlings can be directly sown or planted in between the \\nmulching material. On vegetable plots it is best to apply mulch only after  the young plants have \\nbecome somewhat hardier, as they may be harmed by the products of decomposition from fresh mulch \\nmaterial.  \\n \\nFIGURE 4-4 - MULCH APPLIED IN VEGE TABLE FIELDS IN THE PHILIPPINES ,  \\nWITH RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR THE APPLICATION OF MULCH IN KEY WORD S \\nIf mulch is applied prior  to sowing or planting, the mulch layer should not be too thick in order to \\nallow seedlings to pen etrate it. Mulch can also be applied in established crops, best directly after \\ndigging the soil. It can be applied between the rows, directly around single plants (especially for tree \\ncrops) or evenly spread on the field.  \\nThe Japanese organic pioneer Fukuoka developed a system of growing rice which is based on mulching. \\nWhite clover is sown among the rice one month before harvesting. Shortly thereafter, a winter crop of \\nrye is sown. After thre shing the harvested rice, the rice straw is brought back to the field where it is \\nused as a loose mulch layer. Both the rye and the white clover spring up through the mulch which \\nremains until the rye is harvested. If the straw decomposes too slowly, chick en manure is sprinkled \\nover the mulch. This cropping system does not require any tillage of the soil, but achieves satisfying \\nyields.  \\nIFOAM. 2003. Training Manual for Organic Agriculture in the Tropics.

WATER MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIC \\nAGRICULTURE  \\nScarcity of water for agriculture is a common phenomenon in many countries. In some regions it is \\nalmost impossible to grow crops with out irrigation. Even in areas with large amounts of rainfall in the \\nrainy season, crops may get short of water during dry periods.  \\nOrganic farming aims at optimising the use of on -farm resources and at a sustainable use of natural \\nresources. Active water r etention , water harvesting and storing of water  are important practices, \\nespecially for organic farmers.  Organic farmers know that it is more important to first improve the \\nwater retention and the infiltration of water into the soil.  \\n A. (FIGURE 5-1) \\n\\uf0d8 Keep soil moisture: During dry periods, some soils are more and some are less in a position to \\nsupply crops with water. The ability of a soil to absorb and store water largely depends on the soil \\ncomposition and on the content o f organic matter. Soils rich in clay can store up to three times \\nmore water than sandy soils. Soil organic matter acts as storage of water, just like a sponge. \\nTherefore, crop residue or a cover crop protects the soil, prevents crusting on the surface, and  \\nslows runoff. Roots, earthworms and other soil life maintain cracks and pores in the soil. Less \\nwater runs off, and more sinks into the soil.  \\n\\uf0d8 Reduce evaporation: A thin layer of mulch can considerably reduce the evaporation of water \\nfrom the soil. It sha des the soil from direct sunlight and prevents the soil from getting too warm. \\nShallow digging of the dry top soil can help to reduce the drying up of the soil layers beneath (it \\nbreaks the capillary vessels). A better retention of water within the soil sa ves costs on irrigation.  \\n\\uf0d8 Better use of season’s rainfall: Ripping during the dry season allows farmers to plant earlier – \\nright at the start of the rains.  SUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='33 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 5-1 - APPROACHES FOR WATER CONSERVATION  \\nATTE NTION : A green manure or cover crop is not always a suitable way of reducing evaporation from \\nthe soil, due that they also use water. In dry areas, you should consider using other types of mulch, \\nsuch as crop residues or plant remains brought in from outsi de the field. That will help conserve \\nmoisture in the soil where it can be used by the crop.  \\n \\n 1.INCREASING INFILTRATI ON \\nDuring strong rains, only a part of the water infiltrates into the soil. A considerable part flows away as \\nsurface runoff,  thus being lost for the crop. In order to get as much of the available rainwater into the \\nsoil, the infiltration of rainwater needs to be increased  (Figure 5 -2).  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='34 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 5-2 - INCREASING THE INFILT RATION  \\nThe m ost important for achieving a high infiltration is to maintain a topsoil with a good soil structure \\ncontaining many cavities and  pores ( e.g. from earthworms ). Cover crops and mulch application are \\nsuitable to create such a favourable top soil structure . Further, they help to slow down the flow of \\nwater, thus allowing more time for the infiltration.  \\n\\uf0e8Some techniques to harvest water include:  \\nPlanting pits (known as zai in Burkina Faso and tassa in Niger , Figure 5 -3) are hand -dug circular ho les \\nwhich collect water and store it for use by the crop. Each pit is about 20 cm across and 20 cm deep. \\nAfter planting, the holes are left partly open so they collect water. Planting pits take a lot of work to dig \\nwhen the soil is dry. But they produce go od yields in areas where otherwise crops might die because of \\na lack of water. Once made, the pits can be used again, season after season. Leave the soil covered, and \\nadd compost or fertilizer to the pits to increase their fertility.  \\n \\nUpper: Sketches of trenches and semi -circular bunds , lower: photos of a circular bund \\naround a coconut palm and beans with mulch in plant pits.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='35 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 5-3 - ZAI HOLES WITH SORGHU M PLANTS - TYPICAL OF THE SAHEL  \\nSOURCE : IIRR  AND ACT.  2005.  CONSERVATION AGRICULT URE: A MANUAL FOR FARMERS A ND EXTENSION WORKERS  IN AFRICA  \\nIn areas with low r ainfall, there may not be enough water to grow a crop over the whole area. On \\ngentle slopes (less than 3%), one possibility is to use contour bunds and catchment strips. Catchment \\nstrips are areas where no crops are planted. When rain falls on this ground,  it runs  downslope and is \\ntrapped by the contour bund. Plant rows of crops behind the bund to use this water. This can produce \\na good yield even with very little rain. Mulch the cultivated areas with crop residues to prevent erosion, \\nhelp water sink in , and slow evaporation.  \\nThe picture below  (Figure 5 -4) shows an example of a farmer in Botswana, who makes his cropped \\nstrips 0, 8–1 m wide a  3,3 m apart. He subsoils these strips using a tractor -powered subsoiler to a \\ndepth of 0, 7 m. He shapes the land betwee n the strips so it slopes towards the cropped strips, so \\nrainwater will flow towards the crop. He plants two rows of maize in each strip, and sows a cover crop \\nsuch as cowpea in between the strips. The strips are permanent: they can be used to grow crops \\nseason after season. The soil in the strips gradually improves in fertility as crop residues accumulate \\nthere. Rotating maize with a legume crop will improve the soil fertility further. The farmer has been \\nable to grow up to 6 t/ha of maize with less than 4 00 mm/se ason of rain.  \\n \\nFIGURE 5-4 - MAIZE IN PERMANENT ST RIPS  \\nSOURCE : IIRR  AND ACT.  2005.

There are many possibilities \\nof storin g rainwater for irrigation, but most of them are labouring intensive or costly. Storing water in \\nponds has the advantage that fish may be grown, but water is likely to be lost through infiltration and \\nevaporation. The construction of water tanks may avoid these losses, but needs appropriate \\nconstruction materials. To decide whether or not to build water storage infrastructure, the benefits \\nshould be weighed against the costs, including the loss of arable land.  \\n \\nThe major factors that determine the necessity of irrigation are the selection of crops and an \\nappropriate cropping system. Obviously, not all crops (and not even all varieties of the same crop) \\nrequire the same amount of water, and not all need water over the same period of tim e.  \\nSome crops are very resistant to drought while others are highly susceptible. Deep rooting crops can \\nextract water from deeper layers of soil and hence they are less s ensitive to temporary droughts.  \\nWith the help of irrigation, many crops can nowadays be grown outside their typical agro -climatic \\nregion. This may cause not only the above mentioned negative impacts, but also some advantages. It \\nmay make it possible to cultivate land which would otherwise be unsuitable for agriculture without \\nirrigation. O r the cultivation of sensitive crops can be shifted into areas with  less pest or disease \\npressure.  \\nThere are irrigation systems of higher or lower efficiency and with more or less negative impact. If \\nirrigation is necessary, organic farmers should carefull y select a system, which is does not overexploit \\nthe water source, does not harm the soil and has no negative impact on plant health.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='38 \\n \\n One promising option are drip irrigation  systems  (Figure 5 -8). From a central tank, water is \\ndistributed through thin per forated pipes directly to the single crop plants. There is a continuous but \\nvery light flow of water, thus allowing sufficient time to infiltrate in the root zone of the crops. In this \\nway, a minimum of water is lost and the soil is not negatively affected .  \\n \\nFIGURE 5-8 - DRIP IRRIGATION  \\nThe establishment of drip irrigation systems can be quite costly. However, some farmers have \\ndeveloped low cost drip irrigation systems from locally available materials. Wha tever irrigation \\nsystem the farmer chooses, he will reach higher efficiency if it is combined with accompanying \\nmeasures for improving the soil structure and the water retention of the soil, as described above.  \\nIFOAM. 2003.

CROP PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT  \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nIn many traditional agricultural systems a diversity of crops in time or space can be found. Knowi ng \\nthat different plants have different requirements for nutrients, a good crop planning and management \\nis required in order to optimise the use of nutrient in the soil. Crop rotation, intercropping, cover crops \\nand green manures represent the main alterna tives to the farmers to manage soil health and fertility. \\nThe first three practices will be described in this section.   \\n \\nCrop rotation means changing the type of crops grown in the field each season or each year (IIRR and \\nACT 2005). It is a cr itical feature of all organic cropping system, because it provides the p rincipal \\nmechanisms for building  healthy soils, a major way to control pests, weeds, and to maintain soil \\norganic matter (Mohler and Johnson 2009). In more details, crop rotation bring s the following benefits \\n(IIRR and ACT 2005):  \\n\\uf0b7 It improves soil structure : some crops have strong, deep roots. They can break up hardpans, \\nand tap moisture and nutrients from deep in the soil. Others have many fine, shallow roots. \\nThey tap nutrients near th e surface and bind the soil. They form many tiny holes so that air and \\nwater can get into the soil.  (Figure 6 -1). \\n \\nFIGURE 6-1 - BETTER USE OF ROOT SP ACE IN ASSOCIATED CR OPS \\n\\uf0b7  It increases soil fertility : legu mes (such as groundnuts and beans) fix nitrogen in the soil. \\nWhen their green parts and roots rot, this nitrogen can be used by other crops such as maize. \\nThe result is higher, more stable yields, without the need to apply expensive inorganic \\nfertilizer.  \\n\\uf0b7 It helps control weeds, pests and diseases : planting the same crop season after season \\nencourages certain weeds, insects and diseases. Planting different crops breaks their life cycle \\nand prevents them from multiplying.  \\n\\uf0b7 It produces different types of outp ut: growing a mix of grain, beans, vegetables and fodder \\nmeans a more varied diet and more types of produce to sell.  \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='40 \\n \\n \\uf0b7 In some ways, crop rotation takes the place of ploughing the soil : it helps aerate the soil, \\nrecycles nutrients, and helps control weeds, pests and diseases. Intercropping, strip cropping \\nand relay cropping bring many of the same advantages as rotation.  \\na) Crop selection  \\nBefore selecting the crops, it is necessary to answer the following question:  \\n\\uf0a7 What to produce?  Crops produce many different things: food, fodder, firewood, fence poles, thatch \\nand medicines. Farmers grow some crops (such as cotton) only for cash. For other crops, such as \\ncereals or vegetables, you may be able to sell what you do not use yourself. If your objective is \\nmarketing, make sure that there is a market of your main output or rotation crop.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Will it grow well?  This depends on many factors: the amount of rain or moisture in the soil, the \\nseason (some crops and varieties do not grow well at certa in times of year), the soil fertility, among \\nothers.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 What are the roots like?  Tall cereals (millet, maize, sorghum, etc. ), finger millets and some \\nlegumes (e.g., pigeonpea and sunn hemp) have strong roots that penetrate deep into the soil – up to \\n1,2 m fo r tall cereals. Their roots improve the soil structure and porosity, so are a good choice if the \\nsoil is compacted. (Figure 6 -2). \\n \\nFIGURE 6-2 - DIFFERENT CROPS HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF R OOTS  \\n\\uf0a7 Does it improve t he soil fertility?  Legumes improve the soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the \\nair. They use part of it for their own needs, and leave the rest in the soil. Cereals and other plants \\ncan use this nitrogen if they are intercropped with the legume, or if t hey are grown as the next crop \\nin the rotation.  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Does it cover the soil well?  Tall cereals do not cover the soil well because they have upright leaves \\nand they are planted far apart. Short grasses (Brachiaria, Cenchrus, Andropogon) and many \\nlegumes (labla b, groundnut, cowpea, beans) cover the ground very quickly after they are planted. \\nWhen their main use is indeed to provide cover, we call them cover crops. If their main use is to \\nprovide food, we call them food legumes (beans, groundnuts).  \\n \\n\\uf0a7 Does it work with other crops?  Try to find combinations of crops that com plement each other \\nwell (Table 6 -1). For example, cereals grow well with legumes (either food legumes or cover crops): \\nthe cereals benefit from the nitrogen fixed by the legume. Two different legu mes or two different \\ncereals do not usually work well together.

It may be \\nmore difficult to find the right combination of crops for your situation. You and your neighbours \\ncan try out new combinations to see which ones work. Or you can check with extension workers, \\nresearchers or farmers in other villages to see what they suggest.  \\nTABLE 6-1 - COMPANION PLANTING (KUEPPER  AND  DODSON  2001)  \\nFamily  Good companions   Bad companions (antagonists)  \\nAsparagus  Tomato, parsley, basil    \\nBeans  Most vegetable and herbs  Onion, garlic, gladiolus  \\nBeans, bush  Potatoes, cucumber, corn, strawberry, celery, summer savory  Onion  \\nBeans, pole  Corn, summer savory, celery  Onion, beets, kohlrabi, sunflower  \\nBeets  Cabbage and onion families, lettuce  Pole beans  \\nCabbage family  Aromatic herbs, celery, beets, onion family, chamomile, spinach, chard  Dill, strawberry, pole beans, tomatoes  \\nCarrots  Peas, lettuce, rosemary, onion family, sage, tomato, leeks  Dill  \\nCelery  Onion and cabbage families, tomato, bush beans, nasturtium, leeks    \\nCorn  Potatoes, beans, peas, cucumber, pumpkin, squash  Tomatoes  \\nCucumber  Beans, corn, peas, sunflower, radish  Potatoes and aromatic herbs  \\nEggplant  Beans, marigolds    \\nLeeks  Onions, celery and carrots    \\nLettuce  Carrots, ra dish, strawberry, cucumber, onions    \\nOnion family  Beets, carrots, lettuce, cabbage family, summer savory, leeks  Beans and peas  \\nParsley  Tomato and asparagus    \\nPeas  Carrots, radish, turnip, cucumber, corn, beans  Onion Family, gladiolus, potatoes  \\nPotatoe s Beans, corn, cabbage family, marigolds, horseradish  Pumpkin, squash, tomato, cucumber , sunflower  \\nPumpkin  Corn, marigold  Potato  \\nRadish  Peas, nasturtium, lettuce, cucumber  Hyssop  \\nSpinach  Strawberry, faba beans    \\nSquash  Nasturtium, corn, marigold  Potat oes \\nStrawberry  Bush beans, spinach, lettuce, onion family  Cabbage  \\nSunflower  Cucumber  Potatoes  \\nTomato  Onion family, nasturtium, marigold, asparagus, carrot, parsley, cucumber  Potatoes, fennel, cabbage family  \\nTurnip  Peas  Potatoes  \\n \\nb) Choosing the right va rieties  \\nFarmers all know that not all sorghum is the same. Some varieties grow quickly and produce a yield in \\na short time. Others take longer until harvest. Some are taller than others, or produce more leaves. \\nSome demand more or less nutrients, some are  more tolerant to drought or Striga. The same is true for \\nother crops. For example, some varieties of cowpeas can be harvested in 55 days; others take more \\nthan 100 days. Some climb, while others crawl on the ground. Choose a variety that has the \\ncharacter istics you want. Make sure you get the right seed. If you find a variety that you like, consider \\nproducing your own seed to sow in the future.  \\nc) Choosing a crop rotation  \\nWhat crops should you plant next year, and the year after that? That depends on many f actors , here \\nare some considerations:  \\n\\uf0a7 Knowing the family where your crops belong to helps you to decide what to plant on the next \\ncropping season, by planting a crop that belongs to a different family to the previous one.

Avoid crop combinations where this is a problem.  \\n- Markets do not always exist for new crops;  however you  may want to plant some of them as part of \\nyour rotation. However. If your objective is marketing, ensure that there is a market f or your main \\noutput and rotation crops.  \\n- In addition it is important to check the source of seeds and price of the output before you decide \\nwhich crops to plant.  \\n- Grow tomatoes AFTER  peas, lettuce, or s pinach, because tomatoes need a considerable amount of \\nnutrients.  \\n- Grow lettuce BEFORE  potatoes, because it is a light feeder and an aboveground crop.  \\n- Grow legume cover crops BEFORE  potatoes or corn, so that they can feed the crops.  \\n- Grow potatoes BEFORE  crops that are poor competitors, because potato production involves \\naggressive cultivation and further working of the soil during harvest, both of which reduce weed \\npressure.  \\n- AVOID growing potatoes before corn, because both are heavy feeders.  \\n- BE CAUTIOUS  when  growing bell pepper before another vegetable crop, because of diseases.  \\n- AVOID planting potatoes after corn, because of wireworm problems.  \\n\\uf0a7 Grow beans AFTER  corn to rebuild nitrogen.  \\n\\uf0a7 AVOID growing legumes before small grains to pr event lodging.  \\n\\uf0a7 Use a summer fallow AFTER  onions, because usually there are many weeds.  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='43 \\n \\n  \\n\\uf0a7 Grow peas BEFORE  fall greens, because there is time for double cropping, and fall greens \\nbenefit from the nit rogen fixed by the peas.  \\n\\uf0a7 Grow a root crop like beets AFTER  lettuce or cabbage  \\n \\nIntercropping refers to the practice of growing two or more crops in close proximity: growing two or \\nmore cash crops together, growing a cash crop with a cover cro p, or other non -cash crop that provide \\nbenefits to the primary crop ( Mohler and Johnson 2009) .  \\nHowever, this practice requires additional management to keep competition between intercropped \\nspecies in balance. When two or more crops are growing together, each must have adequate space to \\nmaximize cooperation and minimize competition between them. To accomplish this, four things need \\nto be considered:  \\n1) Spatial arrangement,  \\n2) Plant density,  \\n3) Maturity dates of the crops being grown,  \\n4) Plant architecture.  \\nThere a re at least four basic spatial arrangements  used in intercropping. Most practical s ystems are \\nvariations of these:  \\n\\uf0b7 Row intercropping —growing two or more crops at the same time with at least one crop \\nplanted in rows. This can be beneficial in situations whe n using tall crops to reduce drought or \\nheat stress of shorter crops, by providing shade and reducing wind speed.  (Figure 6 -3). \\n \\nFIGURE 6-3 - ROW INTERCROPPING WIT H ALTERNATE ROWS OF MAIZE AND BEANS  (LEFT )  \\nROW INTERCROPPING WIT H ALTERNATE ROWS OF A CEREAL AND A GRASS  COVER CROP  (RIGHT ) \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strip intercropping —growing two or more crops together in strips wide enough to permit \\nseparate crop production using machines but close enough for the crops to interact, for \\nexample, intercropping beans and maize. Legumes have a nitrogen -fixing bacteria associated \\nwith their roots. Consequently they compete slightly with non -legumes for nutrients, and in \\nsome cases even supply nitrogen to adjacent plants.  (Figure 6 -4). \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='44 \\n \\n  \\nFIGU RE 6-4 - STRIP INTERCROPPING  \\n\\uf0b7 Relay intercropping —planting a second crop into a standing crop at a time when the \\nstanding crop is at its reproducti ve stage but before harvesting (e .g transplanting lettuce next  \\nto tomatoes plants ). The lettuce will use the space that is not yet occupied by the tomatoes and \\nis harvested about the time the tomatoes are branching out to cover the width of the bed.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mixed intercropping —growing two or more crops together in no distinc t row arrangement \\n(for further details of possible combination, please see Table 6-1). Some crops may also be \\nsown as a border crop or as a trap crops at the hedges of the main crop to reduce pests. The \\npest, arriving in the field from the edges, encounter  the trap crop (which is strongly preferred \\nthan the main crop) and stops. The trap crop may be sprayed with natural insecticide to \\ncontrol the pest, before it moves to the main crop.  (Figure 6 -5). \\n \\nFIGURE 6-5 - MIXED INTERCROPPING (NO ROWS ) \\nA crop mixture with different growth forms or development  may make cultivation and use of \\nmulches more difficult and less effective. Therefore planting crop in alternate rows  greatly simplifies \\nmanagement.  \\nIntercropping m ay also represent a problem for crop rotation. Knowing that one fundamental \\nprinciple of crop rotation is the separation of plant families in time, replanting two families mixed in \\nthe same field may be difficult. However, a good planning could maintain a viable crop rotation. For \\nexample, suppose that a farm grows an area with tomato, squash, broccoli and lettuce. A simple \\nrotation would put each of the crops in a different year, with a three year interval before a crop is \\nrepeated on the same bed in order  to keep some diseases and pest under control.  \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content=\"45 \\n \\n  \\nEvery plant which covers the soil and improves soil fertility can be a cover crop.

In this case, cropping provides animals with \\nfodder from grass and nitrogen -binding legu mes, leys (improved fallow with sown legumes, grasses or \\ntrees), weeds and crop residues. Animals graze under trees or on stubble, they provide draught and \\nmanure for crops, while they also serve as a savings account  (FAO, 2001).  \\nAn experimental farm in Th ailand maintains pigs and chickens, as well as a vegetable garden and a fish \\npond. Animal wastes are used for fertilizer, fish feed and biogas generation. Crop and human wastes \\nare also added to the biogas unit. Liquid effluent from the biogas generator is  used in the fishpond and \\nsolid residues on the garden.

NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT  \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nSoil is a living system and soil fertility is the key to agr icultural productivity. The maintenance of the \\nfertility of the soil is the primary step in any agricultural system. The plethora of microorganism \\ninherent in any soil system ensures that nutrient cycle is in place and the large substrate is broken \\ndown to  minute particles that can be easy assimilated by the plant’s root system. Therefore farmers \\nshould maintain the inherent soil fertility by replacing the nutrients removed by the crops or livestock \\ngrazing  by using green manures, animal manures (raw or co mpost ed) and other natural  fertilizers  \\n(e.g. rock phosphate) . \\nThe input and output of plant nutrients must be monitored through a soil testing program, to ensure \\nthat nutrient depletion does not take place. Soils deficient in nutrient cannot support either  crop \\nproduction or active populations of beneficial microorganisms, which are essential for a productive \\nsoil.  (Figure 7 -1 & 7 -2). \\n \\nFIGURE 7-1 - WHY ORGANIC MATTER IS SO IMPORTANT  \\n \\nFIGURE 7-2 - HOW TO IMPROVE AND MA INTAIN SOIL FERTILIT Y \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='51 \\n \\n Improvement in agricultural sustainability requires, alongside effective water and crop management, \\nthe optimal use and management of soil fertility and soil physical propertie s (Figure 7 -3). Both rely on \\nsoil biological process and soil biodiversity. This requires the adoption of management practices that \\nenhance soil biological activity and build -up long term soil productivity and health.  \\n \\nFIGURE 7-3 - FACTORS INFLUENCING S OIL FERTILITY  \\nThe main practices to enhance soil fertility include the use of organic fertilizers  such as  (Figure 7 -4): \\nA. Compost and vermicompost  \\nB. Green manures  \\nC. Animal manure  \\nD. Microbial fertilizers  \\nE. Mineral fertili zers  \\n \\nFIGURE 7-4 - HOW TO INCREASE THE C ONTENT OF SOIL ORGAN IC MATTER  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='52 \\n \\n  \\nComposting is the process of transforming organic materials of plant or animal origin into humus in \\nheaps or pits. Compared with uncontrolled decomposition of organic material, decomposition in the \\ncomposting process occurs at a faster rate, reaches higher temperatures and results in a product of \\nhigher quality.  \\nWithin the process of composting , three  main phases can be disting uished: the heating phase, the  \\ncooling phase and the maturing phase. However, these phases cannot be clearly separated from one \\nanother.  (Figure 7 -5 & 7-6 and Table 7 -1). \\n 1.THE HEATING PHASE : \\n\\uf0b7 Within 3 days of setting up the compost heap, the temperature in t he heap rises to 60 to 70 °C and \\nusually stays at this level for 2 –3 weeks. Most of the decomposition occurs during the heating \\nphase.  \\n\\uf0b7 In this phase, it is mainly bacteria which are active. The high temperature is a result of energy \\nreleased during convers ion of easily decomposable material by the bacteria. The warm \\ntemperature is a typical and important part of the composting process. The heat destroys diseases \\npests, weed roots and seeds.  \\n\\uf0b7 During this first phase of the composting process , the bacteria hav e a very high oxygen demand \\ndue to the rapid development of their population. High temperatures in the heap signal that there \\nis an adequate supply of oxygen for the bacteria. If there is not enough air in the heap, bacterial \\ndevelopment will be hindered a nd the compost will develop an unpleasant odour.  \\n\\uf0b7 Humidity is also essential to the composting process , as bacteria require humid conditions for \\ntheir work. The need for water is greatest during the heating phase because of high biological \\nactivity and stro ng evaporation occurring during this phase.  \\n\\uf0b7 As the heat increases, the pH of the compost heap rises (i.e. acidity decreases).  \\n 2.THE COOLING PHASE : \\n\\uf0b7 Once the material which is easily digested by the bacteria has been converted, the temperature in \\nthe compost h eap declines slowly and will remain at 25 –45 °C.  \\n\\uf0b7 With the decline in temperature, fungi settle and start the decomposition of straw, fibres and \\nwooden material. As this decomposition process is slower, the temperature of the heap does not \\nrise.  \\n\\uf0b7 As the temp erature drops, the pH of the composting material declines (i.e. acidity increases).  \\n 3.THE MATURING PHASE : \\n\\uf0b7 During the maturing phase nutrients are mineralised and humic acids and antibiotics are built -up. \\n\\uf0b7 Red compost worms and other soil organisms start to in habit the heap during this phase.  \\n\\uf0b7 At the end of this phase the compost has lost about half of its original volume, has the colour of \\ndark, fertile soil and is ready to use.  \\n\\uf0b7 The longer it is stored from now on, the more it loses its quality as a fertilizer,  while its capacity to \\nimprove soil structure increases.  \\n\\uf0b7 In the maturing phase, the compost needs much less water than in the heating phase.  \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='53 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 7-5 - THE PROCESS OF COMPOS TING – HOW WASTES BECOME HU MUS \\n \\nFIGURE 7-6 - HOW TO MAKE COMPOST  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 54}, page_content='54 \\n \\n TABLE 7-1 - POSSIBLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION S IN THE COMPOSTING PROCESS  \\n \\n 4.DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND  METHODS  \\nCompost systems can be  divided into «continuously» and «batch -fed» systems:  \\n\\uf0b7 Continuously fed systems : These systems do not heat -up during the composting process. They \\nare handy if there is a continuous supply of wastes (e.g. kitchen waste). However, they lack the \\nadvantages of the heating phase.  \\n\\uf0b7 Batch -fed systems  (all material is composted at once): These systems lead to a hot composting \\nprocess. They offer the advantages of reduced nutrient loss death of weed seeds and diseases as a \\nresult of the high temperature of composting , the process is fast (within a few weeks) and it results \\nin a compost of superior quality. If little water is available, composting in pits may be more \\nappropriate since humidity is conserved better in pits than in heaps.  \\n\\uf0b7 Vermi -composting : is a method of  composting using earthworms. Earthworms speed up the \\ncomposting process, aerate the organic material and enhance the finished compost with nutrients \\nand enzymes from their digestive tracts. Vermicomposting allows you to create compost round the \\nyear, indo or during the winter and outdoor during the summer  (Figure 7 -7).  \\n \\nFIGURE 7-7 - VERMI -COMPOSTING  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='55 \\n \\n  \\nGreen manures are plants grown to accumulate nutrients for the main crop. When they have built  up \\nmaximum biomass, they are worked into the surface soil. As they are usually cut before flowering, \\ngrowing a green manure is thus different from growing a legume crop in the rotation. Once worked \\ninto the soil the fresh plant material releases nutrients  quickly and will be fully decomposed within a \\nshort period of time. Old or coarse material (e.g. straw, twigs , etc. ) will decompose at a slower rate \\nthan fine material and will therefore contribute more to the build -up of soil organic matte r than to \\nferti lizing the crop.  \\nAn alternative to sowing a green manure crop in the field is to collect fresh plant material from \\nelsewhere and work it into the soil. For example, trees and/or shrubs growing alongside crops in an \\nagroforestry system may provide a large q uantity of green material which can be used as green \\nmanure or for mulching  (Figure 7 -8). \\n \\nFIGURE 7-8 - HOW TO PRODUCE MORE BIOMASS ON THE FARM  \\n 1.GREEN MANURES HAVE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS : \\n\\uf0b7 They penetrate the soi l with their roots, make it more friable and bind nutrients, which would \\notherwise be washed away.  \\n\\uf0b7 They suppress weeds and protect the soil from erosion and direct sunlight.  \\n\\uf0b7 If legume plants are used, nitrogen is fixed from the air into the soil.  \\n\\uf0b7 Some gree n manures can be used as fodder plants or even to provide food for human consumption \\n(e.g.  beans and peas).  \\n\\uf0b7 By decomposing, green manures release all kinds of nutrients in the correct mixture for the main \\ncrops to utilise thus improving their yield.  \\n\\uf0b7 The in corporated plant material encourages the activity of soil organisms, and builds up organic \\nmatter in the soil. This improves soil structure and water holding capacity.  \\nGreen manuring is thus an inexpensive way to improve soil fertility and the nut rition of  the main crops \\ngrown.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='56 \\n \\n  2.FACTORS TO  CONSIDER BEFORE GROWING GREEN  MANURES : \\n\\uf0b7 Labour is required for tillage, sowing, cutting and incorporation of plants into the soil, and is most \\nintensive where the amount of helpful equipment available is small.  \\n\\uf0b7 If gree n manures are intercropped with the main crops, they compete for nutrients, water and \\nlight.  \\n\\uf0b7 When old or coarse plant material is incorporated into the soil, nitrogen may be temporarily \\nimmobilised and therefore unavailable for plant growth.  \\n\\uf0b7 If food and sp ace are in short supply it may be more appropriate to grow a food crop rather than a \\ngreen manure and recycle the crop residues, or to intercrop a green manure crop with the main \\ncrop.  \\n\\uf0b7 The benefits of green manures occur over the long term and are not alwa ys visible immediately.  \\n 3.HOW TO USE GREEN MANU RES \\na) Sowing the green manure  \\n\\uf0b7 If grown within a crop rotation, the time of sowing must be chosen such that the green manure can \\nbe cut down and worked into the soil before the next crop is sown.  \\n\\uf0b7 Green manures need  water for germination and growth.  \\n\\uf0b7 The ideal seed density must be tested for each individual situation. It depends on the species \\nchosen.  \\n\\uf0b7 In general no additional fertilization is necessary. If legumes are grown in a field for the first time, \\ninoculation o f the seeds with the specific rhizobia may be necessary to profit from nitrogen \\nfixation of the legume.  \\nb) Working the green manure into the soil  (Figure 7 -9) \\n\\uf0b7 Timing : The time gap between digging in the green manure and planting the next crop should not \\nbe lo nger than 2 to 3 weeks , so as to prevent nutrient losses from the decomposing green manure.  \\n\\uf0b7 Crushing : Green manures are worked in most easily when the plants are still young and fresh. If \\nthe green manure plants are tall or contain bulky and hard plant par ts, it is preferable to chop the \\nplants into pieces to allow easier decomposition. The older the plants, the longer decomposition \\nwill take. The best time to dig in green manure plants is just before flowering.  \\n\\uf0b7 Depth of incorporation : Green manures should not be ploughed deeply into the soil. Instead they \\nshould only be worked in to the surface soil (in heavy soils only 5 to 15 cm deep, in light soils 10 to \\nmaximum 20 cm deep). In warm and humid climates the material can also be left on the soil \\nsurface as a mulch layer.

It is \\nimportant that appropriate species are chosen. Most importantly they should be adapted to the local \\ngrowing conditions, especially rainfall and soil, fit into the crop rotation and not pose a risk of \\ntransmitting diseases and pests to other  crops.  (Figure 7 -10).  \\n \\nFIGURE 7-10 - CHARACTERISTICS OF TH E ''IDEAL '' GREEN MANURE PLANT  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='58 \\n \\n  \\nDepending on whether animals are kept in stables or not (part or full time), farmyard manure consis ts \\nof animal excreta and bedding material (usually straw or grass). Farmyard manure is ext remely \\nvaluable organic manure.  \\nSome characteristics and effects of farmyard manure:  \\n\\uf0b7 It contains large amounts of nutrients.  \\n\\uf0b7 Only part of the nitrogen content of manu re is directly available to plants, while the remaining \\npart is released as the manure decomposes. The nitrogen in animal urine is available in the \\nshort -term.  \\n\\uf0b7 When dung and urine are mixed, they form a well -balanced source of nutrients for plants. The \\navailability of phosphorus and potassium from farmyard manure is similar to that from \\nchemical fertilizers. Chicken manure is rich in phosphorus.  However, it is important to be \\naware of the origin of the manure, as chicken manure from conventional farms is co ntaminated \\nby heavy metals . \\n\\uf0b7 Organic manures contribute to the build -up of soil organic matter and thus improve soil \\nfertility.  \\nFarmyard manure should ideally be collected and stored for a while so as to obtain a manure of high \\nquality. The best result is achieved if the farmyard manure is composted. Manure stored under \\nanaerobic conditions (e.g. in water logge d pits) is of inferior quality.  \\nCollection of farmyard manure is easiest if the animals are kept in stables. For storage,  the manure \\nshould be mixed with dry plant material (straw, grass, crop residues, leaves etc.) to absorb the liquid. \\nStraw that has been cut or mashed by spreading it out on a roadside can absorb more water than long \\nstraw.  \\nUsually, the manure is stored ne xt to the stable, either in heaps or in pits. It can also be stored within \\nthe stable as bedding, provided it is covered with fresh bedding material. In any case, the farmyard \\nmanure should be protected from sun, wind and rain. Water logging , as well as dr ying out should be \\navoided, so as to avoid nutrient losses. The storage site should be impermeable and have a slight slope. \\nIdeally, a trench collects the liquid from the manure heap and the urine from the stable. A dam around \\nthe heap prevents uncontrolle d in- and outf low of urine and water.  \\nStoring manure in pits is particularly suitable for dry areas and dry seasons. Storage in pits reduces \\nthe risk of drying out and the need to water the pile. However, there is greater risk of waterlogging and \\nmore effo rt is required as the pit needs to be dug out. For this method , a 90 cm deep pit is dug with a \\nslight slope at the bottom. The bottom is compressed and then first covered with straw. The pit is filled \\nwith layers about 30 cm thick and each layer compressed  and covered with a thin layer of earth. The \\npit is filled up until it stands about 30 cm above ground and t hen covered with 10 cm of soil.  \\nHumidity in the manure heap must be controlled. To avoid nutrient losses, it should neither be too wet \\nnor too dry. Some indicators to monitor the humidity of the manure are  (Figure 7 -11): \\n\\uf0b7 If white fungus appears (threads and white spots), the manure is too dry and should be \\ndampened with water or urine.  \\n\\uf0b7 A yellow -green colour and/or bad smell are signs that the manure i s too wet and not \\nsufficiently aerated.  \\n\\uf0b7 If the manure shows a brown to black colour throughout the heap, the conditions are ideal.

PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT  \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nPest and disease management consists of a range of activities that support each other. Most  \\nmanagement practices are long -term activities that aim at preventing pests and diseases from \\naffecting a crop. Management focuses on keeping existing pest populations and diseases low. Control \\non the other and is  a short -term activity and focuses on killing pest and disease. The general approach \\nin organic agriculture to deal with the causes of a problem rather than treating the symptoms also \\napplies for pest and diseases. Therefore, management is of a much higher  priority than control.  This \\ndocument describes preventive practices, as well as control practices using biological, mechanical \\ncontrol and natural pesticides.  \\nA healthy plant is less vulnerable to pest and disease infestation. Therefore, a major aim for the \\norganic farmer is to create conditions which keep a plant healthy  (Figure 8 -1).  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-1 - FACTORS INFLUENCING P LANT HEALTH  \\nThe interaction between living organisms and their environment is crucial f or a plant‘s health. Plant’s \\nhealth is more at risk in monocultures and on -farm diversification provide a balanced interaction \\nbetween different plants and pests and predators. This is why a well -managed ecosystem can be a \\nsuccessful way of reducing the le vel of pest or disease population. Certain crop varieties have more \\neffective mechanisms than others  due to the adaptive nature to the environment  and therefore have a \\nlower infection risk.  \\nThe health condition of a plant depends to a large exten t on the f ertility of the soil. When nutrition and \\npH is well balanced, the plant becomes stronger and is therefore less vulnerable to infection. Climatic \\nconditions, such as suitable temperatures and sufficient water supply, are further factors which are \\ncrucial fo r a healthy plant. If one of these conditions is not suitable, the plant can become stressed. \\nStress weakens the defence mechanisms of plants and makes them easy targets for pests and diseases. \\nOne of the most important points for an organic farmer is ther efore to grow diverse and healthy plants. \\nThis avoids many pest and disease problems.  (Figure 8 -2). \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='62 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 8-2 - BASICS OF ORGANIC PES T AND DISEASE MANAGE MENT  \\n \\nKnowledge a bout plant health and pest and disease ecology helps the farmer to choose effective \\npreventive crop protection measures. As many factors influence the development of pest and disease, \\nit’s crucial to step in  at the most sensitive points. This can be accomp lished through the right timing of \\nmanagement practices, a suitable combination of different methods, or the choice of a selective \\nmethod. Some important preventive crop protection measures are the following ones:  \\n1)  Selection of adapted and resistant var ieties:   \\n→ Choose varieties which are well adapted to the local environmental conditions (temperature, \\nnutrient supply, pests and disease pressure), as it allows them to grow healthy and makes them \\nstronger against infections of pests and diseases.  \\n2) Select ion of clean seed and planting material:  \\n→ Use safe seeds which have been inspected for pathogens and weeds at all stages of production.  \\n→ Use planting material from safe sources.  \\n3) Use of suitable cropping systems  (see 6. Crop Planning and Management ): \\n→ Mixed  cropping systems: can limit pest and disease pressure as the pest has less host plants to \\nfeed on and more beneficial insect life in a diverse system.  \\n→ Crop rotation: reduces the chances of soil borne diseases and increases soil fertility.  \\n→ Green manuring a nd cover crops: increases the biological activity in the soil and can enhance the \\npresence of beneficial organisms (but also of pests; therefore a careful selection of the proper \\nspecies is needed).  \\n4) Use of balanced nutrient management:  \\n→ Moderate fertiliz ation: steady growth makes a plant less vulnerable to infection. Too much \\nfertilization may result in salt damage to roots, opening the way for secondary infections.  \\n→ Balanced potassium supply contributes to the prevention of fungi and bacterial infections  \\n5) Input of organic matter:  \\n→ Increases micro -organism density and activity in the soil, thus decreasing population densities of \\npathogenic and soil borne fungi.  \\n→ Stabilises soil structure and thus improves aeration and infiltration of water.  \\n→ Supplies substan ces which strengthen the plant‘s own protection mechanisms.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='63 \\n \\n 6) Application of suitable soil cultivation methods:  \\n→ Facilitates the decomposition of infected plant parts.  \\n→ Regulates weeds which serve as hosts for pests and diseases.  \\n→ Protects the micro -organism s which regulate soil borne diseases.  \\n7) Use of good water management:  \\n→ No water logging: causes stress to the plant, which encourages pathogens infections.  \\n→ Avoid water on the foliage, as water borne disease spread with droplets and fungal disease \\ngerminate  in water.  \\n8) Conservation and promotion of natural enemies:  \\n→ Provide an ideal habitat for natural enemies to grow and reproduce.  \\n→ Avoid using products which harm natural enemies.  \\n \\n9) Selection of optimum planting time and spacing:  \\n→ Most pests or diseases att ack the plant only in a certain life stage; therefore it’s crucial that this \\nvulnerable life stage doesn’t correspond with the period of high pest density and thus that the \\noptimal planting time is chosen.  \\n→ Sufficient distance between the plants reduces the  spread of a disease.  \\n→ Good aeration of the plants allows leaves to dry off faster, which hinders pathogen development \\nand infection.  \\n10) Use of proper sanitation measures:  \\n→ Remove infected plant parts (leaves, fruits) from the ground to prevent the disease from \\nspreading.  \\n→ Eliminate residues of infected plants after harvesting.  \\n \\nRegular monitoring of pests, diseases and weeds is the basis for effective management. To be able to \\nmanage pests, diseases and weeds, information is needed on the specific  pests, diseases and weeds \\npresent in the region, village or crop fields and th e associated damage they cause.  \\na) Typical signs of pest attacks on crop plants  \\nMost crop pests belong to the insects, mites and nematodes. However, in Africa, mammals (like \\nelepha nts, monkeys or voles), and birds (like sparrows, starlings an d crows) can also damage crops.  \\nInsect damage can be categorized by biting and chewing (e.g. caterpillars, weevils), piercing and \\nsucking (e.g. aphids, psyllids) and boring (e.g. borer, leaf min er) species. Some are slow moving (e.g. \\ncaterpillars), fast moving (e.g. fruit flies), hidden (e.g. stem borer), or easy to observe  (e.g. caterpillars, \\nweevils).  \\n\\uf0b7 Pest damage  is often species -specific: leaves with holes or missing parts is an indication of  \\ncaterpillar or weevil damage; curled leaves is an indication of aphids; damaged or rotten fruits are \\noften caused by larvae of fruit flies; withering plants can also be caused by larvae of noctuids or the \\nstem borer; and branches or trunks with holes may be an  attack by lignivorous insects.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mites  are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. However, some mite species (spider \\nmites) weave a typical tissue on attacked plant parts and can, therefore, easily be detected. If mites \\nare present on plants , leav es and fruits become yellowish.  \\n\\uf0b7 Nematodes  are also very small and therefore, they are not easy to observe with the naked eye. \\nThey mostly attack plant roots; plants become yellow, wither and die.  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='64 \\n \\n b) Typical signs of disease attacks on crop plants  \\nMost c rop diseases are caused by fungi, b acteria or viruses.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fungi  cause the great majority, estimated at two -thirds, of infectious plant diseases. They include \\nall white and true rusts, smuts, needle casts, leaf curls, mildew, sooty moulds and anthracnose. In \\naddition, they are responsible for most leaf, fruit, and flower spots, cankers, blights, wilts, scabs, \\nand root, stem, fruit, wood rots among many others. Parts of plants or the total  crop plant can \\nwither and die.  \\n\\uf0b7 Bacteria  cause any of the four following main problems. Some bacteria produce enzymes that \\nbreakdown the cell walls of plants anywhere in the plant. This causes parts of the plant to start \\nrotting (known as ‘rot’). Some bacteria produce toxins that are generally damaging to plant tissues, \\nusually  causing early death of the plant. Others produce large amounts of very sticky sugars; as they \\ntravel through the plant, they block the narrow channels preventing water getting from the plant \\nroots up to the shoots and leaves, again causing rapid death of the plant. Finally, other bacteria \\nproduce proteins that mimic plant hormones. These lead to overgrowth of plant tissue and form \\ntumours.  \\n\\uf0b7 Viruses  mostly cause systemic diseases. Generally, leaves show chlorosis or change in colour of \\nleaves and other gree n parts. Light green or yellow patches of various shades, shapes and sizes \\nappear in affected leaves. These patches may form characteristic mosaic patterns, resulting in \\ngeneral reduction in growth and vigour of the plant.  \\nCareful and continuous monitoring  of pest and disease levels during critical times of growth of a crop \\nis the key to successful management. This can be done through regular scouting of the field by the \\nfarmer. It helps the farmer to intervene early enough before the pest and/or disease ca use significant \\ndamage.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-3 - SCOUTING PATTERN - ZIG-ZAG (OR M-SHAPPED ) ROUTE THROUGH THE FI ELD \\nScouting (Figure 8 -3) avoids unnecessary use of natural plant extracts. Limited use of these substance s \\n(e.g. pyrethrum, derris and tobacco) and oils is important as they also have negative effects on \\nbeneficial insects. If the application of these substances is not regulated, many pest predators and \\nparasitoids may be killed as well. Over application of t hese substances may also lead to pests \\ndeveloping resistance. Therefore, scouting should be planned and done in an organised way. It is \\nimportant to get a random sample that will be representative of the overall situation in the crop \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='65 \\n \\n garden. Therefore, the  scout (farmer) needs to observe and record any of the findin gs for better \\ndecision making.  \\nThe most common pattern in pest and disease scouting programs involves walking along a \\npredetermined zigzag or M -shaped route through a field. This pattern is comm only used because it is \\neasy to teach, convenient to use, and ensures that all regions of the field are visited. To monitor insect \\npests, different traps can also be used  (Figure 8 -4 & 8-5). The simple idea is to know more about the \\npresence of the insect pests in the field especially the fast moving (mobile) insect pests (e.g. fru it flies, \\nlepidopteran pests).  \\n\\uf0d8 Fruit flies can be captured using bait traps . For example, PE -bottles with small holes can be half -\\nfilled with water, some cattle urine, fruit fles h or a small dead fish and a drop of detergent or \\nsoapy water. These bottles are then hung in trees and checked every three days.  \\n \\n\\uf0d8 Yellow plastic cards coated with adhesive  are also good for trapping aphids and leafhopper. \\nYellow -orange plastic boards are  appropriate for white flies, while blue cards are appropriate for \\nthrips monitoring.  \\n \\n\\uf0d8 Light traps  are especially needed where noctuids (e.g. moths, cutworms, African armyworm, and \\ncotton bollworm) are a problem. Within crops attacked by cutworms, visual checks of caterpillars \\nhave to be done by dawn.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-4 - TRAPS TO MONITOR INSE CT PESTS  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-5 - HOW TO MAKE A FRUIT F LY TRAP  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content='66 \\n \\n Organic management and control of diseases is based strongly on strengthening the plant with the aim \\nof enhancing its self -defence and thereby preventing the outbreak of the disease. One typical \\nexpression of induced resistance is the thickening of cell  walls of the plant, which interferes with \\npathogen entering the cell. Another is the dying of the infested cell walls, which causes the pathogen to \\ndie also, and thus reduce its spread.  \\nThere are several resistance -inducing substances that can be prepared  by the farmers themselves. \\nSome are plant extracts made from efeu ( Hedera helix) , rhubarb ( Rheum rhabarbarum) , or giant \\nknotweed ( Reynoutria sachalinensis).  \\nCompost teas and herbal teas are tools that can be made on the farm to enhance crop health and \\nfertility, and to inoculate the leaves and roots with soluble nutrients, beneficial microorganisms, and \\nbeneficial metabolites (products that aid in the grow th and development of plants).  \\nCompost extract  is a fertilizer, but it also can induce plant resista nce. For its preparation, mature \\ncompost is mixed with water at a ra tio of 1:5 to 1:8 (vol/vol: 1L of compost for every 5 to 8 L of water) \\nand well stirred before it is left to ferment for 3 -7 days. One spoonful of molasses can be added per \\nlitre  of liquid , because this enhances  the development of the microorganisms. The fermentation site \\nshould be shaded and safe from the rain. After the fermentation period and before the application, the \\nextract is well stirred, then filtered and dil uted at a ratio of 1:5  to 1:10.  \\nPlant extracts can be obtained from stinging nettle, horsetail, comfrey, clover, seaweed and others, \\nalone or mixed with marine by -products such as fish waste or fishmeal. Dilutions of 1:10 or 1:5 are  \\nused as foliar spray or soil drench.  \\nAs a gen eral rule it is recommended to apply compost extracts or teas every 7 to 10 days to prevent \\ndiseases from developing and as a way t o enhance soil microorganisms.  \\n \\nThe natural enemies of pests are othe r organisms (fungi, bacteria, viruses, insect predators, and insect \\nparasitoids) which kill pest. Therefore, the organic farmer should try to conserve natural enemies \\nalready present in the crop environment and enhance their impact. This can be achie ved wi th the \\nfollowing methods:  \\n\\uf0b7 Minimize the application of natural pesticides (chemical pesticides anyway are not per -mitted in \\norganic farming).  \\n\\uf0b7 Allow some pests to live in the field which will serve as food or host for natural enemies.  \\n\\uf0b7 Establish a diverse cro pping system (e.g. mixed cropping).  \\n\\uf0b7 Include host plants providing food or shelter for natural enemies (e.g. flowers which adult \\nbeneficial insects feed on).  \\nThere are many possibilities to enhance floral diversity within and along  the boundaries of crop fi elds  \\n(Figure 8 -6): \\n\\uf0a7 Hedge s - Use indigenous shrubs known to attract pest predators and parasitoids by offering \\nnectar, pollen, alternative hosts and/or preys. Most flowering shrub species have this property. \\nHowever, care should be taken to not use plant sp ecies known to be alternative hosts of pests or \\ndiseases.  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content='67 \\n \\n \\uf0a7 Beetle banks  - Strips of grass in the neighbourhood of crop fields harbour different natural pest \\nenemy groups like carabids, staphylinid beetles and spiders. In order to lower the risk of weeds \\nand plants known as host plants of crop pests and diseases, one to three native grass species can \\nbe sown in strips of 1 to 3  m. \\n\\uf0a7 Flower strips  - Use indigenous flowering plant species known to attract predators and \\nparasitoids by offering nectar, pollen, alte rnative hosts and/or  preys. Most flowering plant species \\nhave this property. However, care should be taken not to use alternative hosts of pests or diseases. \\nThree to five native flowering plant species can be sown in well -prepared seed beds, arranged in \\nstrips of 1 to 3 m on the boundary of the crop field. After flowering, seeds can be collected to \\nrenew the strip or create new ones.  \\n\\uf0a7 Companion plants  - Natural pest enemies can also be attracted by companion plants within a \\ncrop. These companion plant spec ies can be the same as used in the flower strips. A few (1 or 2 \\nper 10  m2) flowering companion plants within a crop serve as a ‘service station’ for natural pest \\nenemies.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-6 - ENHANCING BIOLOGICAL CONTROL  \\nMass -trapping of pests is an additional control measure. They often can easily be built with cheap \\nmaterial. Some examples include:  \\n\\uf0d8 Light traps  can be used to catch moths such as armyworms, cutworms, stem borers and other \\nnight fl ying insects. Light traps are more efficient when placed soon after the adult moths start to \\nemerge but before they start laying eggs. However, light traps have the disadvantage of attracting a \\nwide range of insect species. Most of the attracted insects ar e not pests. In addition, many insects \\nthat are attracted to the area around the light traps (sometimes from considerable distances) do \\nnot actually fly into the trap. Instead, they remain nearby, actually increasing the total number of \\ninsects in the imme diate area.  \\n\\uf0d8 Colour and water traps  can be used to monitor adult thrips. In some cases thrips can even be \\nreduced by mass trapping with coloured (blue, yellow or white) sticky traps or water traps in the \\nnursery or field. The colour spectrum of the boards is important for the efficacy of the sticky traps. \\nBright colours attract more thrips than darker ones. Sticky traps with cylindrical surfaces are more \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content='68 \\n \\n efficient that flat surfaces. They are best placed within a meter of crop level. Traps should not be \\nplaced near the borders of fields or near shelter belts.  \\n\\uf0d8 Water traps  should be at least 6 cm deep with a surface area of 250 to 500 cm2, and preferably \\nround, with the water level about 2 cm below the rim. A few drops of detergent added to the water \\nensure th at thrips sink and do not drift to the edges and escape. Replace or add water regularly.  \\n\\uf0d8 Yellow sticky traps  can be used to control whiteflies, aphids and leaf mining flies. Yellow plastic \\ngallon containers mounted upside down on sticks coated with transp arent car grease or used \\nmotor oil, is one such trap. These should be placed in and around the field at about 10 cm above \\nthe foliage. Clean and re -oil when traps are covered with flies. Yellow sticky boards have a similar \\neffect. To use, place 2 to 5 yell ow sticky cards per 500 m2 field area. Replace traps at least once a \\nweek. To make your own sticky trap, spread petroleum jelly or used motor oil on yellow painted \\nplywood (size 30 cm x 30 cm). Place traps near the plants but faraway enough to prevent the \\nleaves from sticking to the board. Note that the yel low colour attracts many insect. Note that the \\nyellow colour attracts many insect species, including beneficial insects, so use yellow traps only \\nwhen necessary.  \\n\\uf0d8 Fruit bagging  prevents fruit flies from la ying eggs on the fruits  (Figure 8 -7). In addition, the bag \\nprovides physical protection from mechanical injuries (scars and scratches). Although laborious, it \\nis cheap, safe and gives a more reliable estimate of the projected harvest. Bagging works well wi th \\nmelon, bitter gourd, mango, guava, star fruit, avocadoes and banana (plastic bags used).  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-7 - FRUIT BAGGING  \\nRecommendations to farmers regarding fruit bagging : Cut old newspapers to fruit size an d \\ndouble the layers, as single layers break apart easily. Fold and sew or staple the sides and bottom \\nof the sheets to make a rectangular bag. Blow in the bag to inflate it. Insert one fruit per bag then \\nclose the bag and firmly tie the top end of the bag with sisal string, wire and banana fibre or \\ncoconut midrib. Push the bottom of the bag upwards to prevent fruit from touching the bag. For \\nexample, start bagging the mango fruit 55 to 60 days from flower bloom or when the fruits are \\nabout the size of a chi cken egg. When using plastic bags (e.g. with bananas), open the bottom or cut \\na few small holes to allow moisture to dry up. Moisture trapped in the plastic bags damages and/or \\npromotes fungal and bacterial growth that causes diseased fruits. Plastic also overheats the fruit. \\nBags made of dried plant leaves are good alternatives to plastic.  \\n \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='69 \\n \\n Biological control is the use of natural enemies to manage populations of pests (such as ladybird \\nbeetles, predatory gallmidges, hoverfly larvae ag ainst aphids and psyllids) and diseases  (Figure 8 -8). \\nThis implies that we are dealing with living systems, which are complex and vary from place to place \\nand from time to time.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-8 - POPULATION DYN AMICS OF PESTS AND P REDATORS  \\nIf populations of natural enemies present in the field are too small to sufficiently control pests, they \\ncan be reared in a laboratory or rearing unit. The reared natural enemies are released in the crop to \\nboost field populati ons and keep pest populations down. There are two approaches to biological \\ncontrol through the release of natural enemies:  \\n\\uf0b7 Preventive release of the natural enemies at the beginning of each season. This is used when the \\nnatural enemies could not persist fr om one cropping season to another due to unfavourable \\nclimate or the absence of the pest. Populations of the natural enemy then establish and grow \\nduring the season.  \\n\\uf0b7 Releasing natural enemies when pest populations start to cause damage to crops  (Figure 8 -9). \\nPathogens are usually used in that way, because they cannot persist and spread in the crop \\nenvironment w ithout the presence of a host (“pest” ). They are also often inexpensive to produce.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-9 - RELEASING NATURAL ENEM IES \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content='70 \\n \\n Natural enemies that kill or suppress pests or diseases are often fungi or bacteria. They are called \\nantagonists or referred to as microbial insecticides or bio -pesticides. Some commonly used \\nantagonistic microbes are:  \\n\\uf0d8 Bacteria  such  as Bacillus thuringiensis  (Bt). Bt has be en available as a commercial mi crobial \\ninsecticide since the 1960s. Different types of Bt are available for the control of caterpillars and \\nbeetles in vegetables and other agricultural crops, and for mosquito and b lack fly control. The best -\\nknown biocontrol agent used in field crops is the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and \\nBacillus thuringiensis. var. aizawai  against diverse lepidopteran pests, and the Bacillus thuringiensis  \\nvar israeliensis  against mosquitoes . Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki  is produced in local factories \\nin different African countries (e.g. South Africa, Kenya and Mozambique) and can be used against \\ndifferent pests (African armyworm, African bollworm, bean armyworm, beet armywor m, cabbage \\nwebworm, cabbage moth, cabbage looper, cotton leafworm, diamondback moth, giant looper, green \\nlooper, spiny bollworm, spotted bollworm, pod borers, tomato looper).  \\n\\uf0d8 Viruses  such as NPV (nuclearpolyhedrosis virus), effective for control of several  cater -pillar pest \\nspecies. Every insect species, however, requires a specific NPV -species. An example: The \\narmyworm Spodoptera exigua  is a major problem in shallot production in Indonesia. Since \\nexperiments showed that SeNPV (NPV specific for S. exigua)  provided better control than \\ninsecticides, farmers have adopted this control method. Many farmers in West -Sumatra are now \\nproducing NPV on -farm.  \\n\\uf0d8 Fungi that kill insects , such as Beauveria bassiana . Different strains of this fungus are \\ncommercially availabl e. For example: strain Bb 147 is used for control of corn borers ( Ostrinia \\nnubilalis  and O. furnacaiis ) in maize, strain GHA is used against whitefly, thrips, aphids and \\nmealybugs in vegetables and ornamentals. Several species of fungi can occur naturally in \\necosystems. For example, aphids can be killed by a green or white coloured fungus during humid \\nweather.  \\n\\uf0d8 Fungi that work against plant -pathogens . Some examples include: Trichoderma sp ., widely used \\nin Asia for prevention of soil -borne diseases such as da mping -off and root rots in vegetables  (Figure \\n8-10). Some Trichogramma species against the African bollworm are bred in some laboratories in \\nAfrica against lepidopteran pests and aphids.  A successful introduction of the neotropical \\nparasitoid Apoanagyrus lopezi  against the cassava mealybug ( Phenacoccus manihoti ) caused a \\nsatisfactory reduction of P. manihoti in most farmers’ fields in Africa. This is one of the success \\nstories of classical biocontrol.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-10 - BIOCONTROL OF PLANT D ISEASES BY NON -PATHOGENIC FUNGI  \\n\\uf0d8 Entomopathogenic nematodes  against different weevil species (e.g. Steinernema carpocapsae, \\nHeterorhabditis bacteriophora ) and to control soil insects like cutworms ( Agrotis spp .) in vegetables.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content='71 \\n \\n Some plants contain components that are toxic to insects. When extracted from the plants and applied \\non infested crops, these components are called botanical pesticides or botanicals. The use of plant \\nextracts to control pests is not ne w. Rotenone ( Derris sp .), nicotine (tobacco), and pyrethrins \\n(Chrysanthemum sp .) have been used widely both in small -scale subsistence farming as well as  in \\ncommercial agriculture.  \\nMost botanical pesticides are contact, respiratory, or stomach poisons. The refore, they are not very \\nselective, but target a broad range of insects. This means that even beneficial organisms can be \\naffected. Yet the toxicity of botanical pesticides is usually not very high and their negative effects on \\nbeneficial organisms can be  significantly reduced by selective application. Furthermore, botanical \\npesticides are generally highly bio -degradable, so that they become inactive within hours or a few days. \\nThis reduces again the negative impact on beneficial organisms and they are rel atively \\nenvironmentally safe  compared to chemical pesticides  (Figure 8 -11). \\n \\nFIGURE 8-11 - THE IMPACT OF CHEMICA L PESTICIDES ON NATU RAL ENEMIES  \\nThe preparation and use of botanicals requires some know -how, b ut not much material and \\ninfrastructures. It’s a common practice under many traditional agricultural systems. Some commonly \\nused botanicals are:  \\n\\uf0d8 NEEM : Neem derived from the neem tree ( Azadiracta indica ) of arid tropical regions, contains \\nseveral  insecticid al compounds. The main active ingredient is azadiractin, which both deters and \\nkills many species of caterpillars, thrips and whitefly. Both seeds and leaves can be used to prepare \\nthe neem solution. Neem seeds contain a higher amount of neem oil, but leav es are available all \\nyear. A neem solution loses  its effectiveness within about 8 hours after preparation, and when \\nexposed to direct sunlight. It is most effective to apply neem in the evening, directly after \\npreparation, under humid conditions or when th e plants and insects are damp. There exist different \\nrecipes for the preparation of a neem solution.  \\nRecommendation to farmers about preparation of neem pesticides : In Ghana, Africa, neem \\nseed kernel extract was tested on cabbage in Farmer trainings and h ad a very good repelling effect \\non diamondback moth ( Plutella xylostella ). Here is their recipe: Pound 30 g neem kernels (that is \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content='72 \\n \\n the seed of which the seed coat has been removed) and mix it in 1 L of water. Leave it overnight. \\nThe next morning, filter the  solution through a fine cloth and use it immediately for spraying. It  \\nshould not be further diluted.  \\nNeem cake (ground neem seed or neem kernel powder) has also a considerable potential as a \\nfertilizer and at the same time it will hinder nematode attacks of the crop roots (e.g. tomato). Put \\nneem cake in the planting pit (200g per m2) and mix it with substrate. The neem cake will repel and \\neven kill nematodes and other root pests. Insecticidal agents (azadirachtin) will be translocated to \\nabove -ground parts  of the plant and help to get rid of pests there . (figure 8 -12).  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-12 - PREPARATION OF A NEEM SOLUTION  \\n\\uf0d8 PYRETHRUM : Pyrethrum is a daisy -like Chrysanthemum. In the tropics, pyrethrum is grown in \\nmounta in areas because it needs cool temperatures to develop its flowers. Pyrethrins are \\ninsecticidal chemicals extracted from the dried pyrethrum flower. The flower heads are processed \\ninto a powder to make a dust. This dust can be used directly or infused into  water to make a spray. \\nPyrethrins cause immediate paralysis to most insects. Lo w doses do not kill but have a “ knock \\ndown”  effect. Stronger doses kill. Pyrethrins break down very quickly in sunlight so they should be \\nstored in darkness. Both highly alkali ne and highly acid conditions speed up degradation so \\npyrethrins should not be mixed with lime or soap solutions. Liquid formulations are stable in \\nstorag e but powders may lose up to 20% of their effectiveness in one year.  \\nRecommendation to farmers about p reparation of Pyrethrum pesticides : Pyrethrum powder \\nis made with dried ground flowers. Use pure or mix with a carrier such as talc, lime or \\ndiatomaceous earth and sprinkle over infested plants. To make liquid pyrethrum extract (mix 20  g \\npyrethrum powder w ith 10  L of water), add soap to make the substance more effective. Strain and \\napply immediately as a spray. For best effects this should be applied in the evening. Pyrethrum can \\nalso be extracted by alcohol.  \\n\\uf0d8 CHILLIPEPPER : Chillies and capsicum pepper have both repellent and insecticidal effects.  \\nRecommendations to farmers on preparation of chilli pesticides : To make the chilli extract \\ngrind 200 g of chillies into a fine dust, boil it in 4 L water, add another 4 L of water and a few drops \\nof liquid soap. Thi s mixture can be sprayed against aphids, ants, small caterpillars and snails.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='73 \\n \\n \\uf0d8 GARLIC : Garlic has antifeedant (insect stop feeding), insecticidal, nematicidal and repellent \\nproperties. Garlic is reportedly effective against a wide range of insects at diffe rent stages in their \\nlife cycle (egg, larvae, adult)  (Figure 8 -13). This includes ants, aphids, armyworms, diamondback \\nmoth, whitefly, wireworm and termites. Garlic is non -selective, has a broad -spectrum effect and \\ncan kill beneficial insects as well. Ther efore, it should be used with caution.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-13 - THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE  RICE YELLOW STEM BOR ER \\nRecommendations to farmers on preparation of garlic pesticides : To make the garlic extract, \\ngrind or chop 1 00 g garlic into 0, 5 L of  water. Allow mixtu re to stand for 24 hours, add 0, 5 L of \\nwater and stir in liquid soap. Dilute at 1:20 with water and spray in the evening. To improve \\nefficacy , chilli extract can be added.  \\n \\nThere are many other extracts of plant s known to have insecticidal effects like tobacco ( Nicotiana \\ntabacum ), yellow root ( Xanthorhiza simplicissima ), fish bean ( Tephrosia vogelii ), violet tree ( Securidaca \\nlongepedunculata ), and nasturtium ( Nasturtium trapaeolum ) which are traditionally us ed to  control \\npests in Africa.  \\nAnise, chillies, chives, garlic, coriander, nasturtium, spearmint and marigold are plants known to have \\na repellent effect on different pest insects (aphids, moths, root flies, etc.) and can be grown as \\nintercrop or at the border  of crop fields  (Figure 8 -14). Marigold is especially known to deter root \\nnematodes, while neem cake is known to deter mice.  \\n \\nFIGURE 8-14 - TRAP CROPPING - TRAP INTERCROPPING  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='74 \\n \\n - Despite being “natural” and widely used in agricultural systems, some botanicals may be dangerous \\nfor humans and they can be very toxic to natural enemies. Nicotine for example, derived from the \\ntobacco plant, is one of the most t oxic organic poisons for humans and other warm -blooded animals. \\nPyrethrins are not poisonous for humans and warm -blooded animals. However, human allergic \\nreactions are common. It can cause rash, and breathing the dust can cause headaches and sickness.  \\n- Before a new botanical pesticide is applied in a large scale, its effect on the ecosystem should be \\ntested in a small field experiment. Do not just use botanical pesticides as a default option! First \\nunderstand the ecosystem and how botanicals influence it!  \\n- Do not have direct skin contact with the crude extract during the process of preparation and \\napplication.  \\n- Contact with plant extracts should be avoided in the eyes.  \\n- Make sure that you place the plant extract out of reach of children during storage.    \\n- Wear protective clothing (eyes, mouth, nose and skin) while applying the extract.  \\n- Wash your hands after handling the plant extract.  \\nBesides extractions of plants, there are some other natural pesticides, which are allowed in organic \\nfarming. Although some of these products have limited selectivity and are not fully biodegradable, \\nthere are situations, when their use is justified. However, in most cases, the desired effect is best \\nreached in combination with preventive crop protection methods. Some examples are: \\n\\uf0b7 Soft soap solutions : against ap hids and other sucking insects.  \\n\\uf0b7 Light mineral oil : against various insect  pests (harms natural enemies!).  \\n\\uf0b7 Sulphur : against spider mites (harms natural enemies!). The acaricidal effect of sulphur is best \\nat temperatures a bove 12° C. However, sulphur has the potential to cause plant injury in dry \\nhot weather (above 32° C). It’s also incompatible with other pesticides. Sulphur should not be \\nused together or after treatments with oil to avoid phytotoxicity . \\n\\uf0b7 Plant ashes : wood ashes from fire places can be efficient against ants, leaf miners, stem borers, \\ntermites and potato moths. Ash should be dusted directly on pest colonies and infested plant \\nparts. The ash will dehydrate the soft bodied pests. Wood ashes are often used when  storing \\ngrains to deter storage pests such as weevils. In addition, ashes are used against soil borne \\ndiseases.  \\n\\uf0d8 Sulphur is mostly used against plant diseases like powdery mildew, downy mildew and oth er \\ndiseases. The key to its efficacy is that it prevents spore germination. For this reason, it must be \\napplied prior to disease development for effective results. Sulphur can be applied as a dust or in \\nliquid form. It is not compatible with other pesticid es. Lime -sulphur is formed when lime is added \\nto sulphur to help it penetrate plant tissue. It is more effective than elemental sulphur at lower \\nconcentrations. However, the odour of rotten eggs usually discourages its use over extensive fields.  \\n\\uf0d8 Bordeaux m ixture  (Copper sulphate and lime) has been successfully used for over 150 years, on \\nfruits, vegetables and ornamentals. Unlike sulphur, Bordeaux mixture is both fungicidal and \\nbactericidal. As such, it can be effectively used against diseases such as leaf spots caused by \\nbacteria or fungi, powdery mildew, downy mildew and various anthracnose pathoge ns. The ability \\nof Bordeaux mix ture to persist through rains and to adhere to plants is one reason it has been so \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='75 \\n \\n effective. Bordeaux mixture contains copper sul phate, which is acidic, and neutralized by lime \\n(calcium hydroxide), which is alkaline.  \\nRecommendations to farmers on preparation of Bordeaux mixture : Bordeaux mixture comes \\nin several formulations. One of the most popular, effective and least phytotoxic formulations for \\ngeneral use is the following formulation: Mix 90 g of blue copper sulphate with 4, 5 L of water (in a \\nnon-metallic container). In another non -metallic container, mix 125 grams of slaked lime with 4.5 \\nlitres of water. Stir both, mix both sol utions, and stir again. This formulation was developed in \\nrecognition of the fact that copper, like sulphur, is phytotoxic and that the level of toxicity is \\nrelated to the age of plant tissue being treated. Application of Bordeaux during hot weather (above  \\n85° F or 30° C) may cause yellowing and leaf drop. Additionally, leaf burn can occur if it rains soon \\nafter a Bordeaux application. Care should be taken when applying this fungicide to young, tender \\nleaves of fruit trees. Do not apply Bordeaux mixture to corn or sorghum, which are described as \\ncopper -sensitive plants. There are other, very common and cheap copper formulations available: \\ncopper hydroxide and copper oxychloride. They are accepted in organic farming provided that the \\nnumber of applications is  strictly followed and a proper soil amendment is observed to prevent \\ncopper accumulation in the soil.  \\n\\uf0d8 Acidic clays  have a fungicidal effect due to aluminium oxide or aluminium sulphate as active \\nagents. They are used as an alternative to copper products but, are often less efficient.  \\n\\uf0d8 Milk has also been used against blights, mildew, mosaic viruses and other fungal and viral diseases. \\nSpraying every 10 days with a mixture of 1 L of milk to 10 to 15 L of water is effective.  \\n\\uf0d8 Baking soda has been used to contr ol mildew and rust diseases on plants. Spray with a mixture of \\n100 g of baking or washing soda with 50 g of soft soap. Dilute with 2 L of water. Spray only once \\nand leave as long gaps as possible (several months). Do not use during hot weather and test the  \\nmixture on a few leaves because of possible phytotoxic effects.  \\nMany plant extracts are known to have fungicidal effects. Onion and garlic are effective against many \\ndiseases such as mildew and fungal and bacterial diseases. Mexican and African marigold a ct as a crop \\n“strengthener ” to help potatoes, beans, tomatoes and peas resist fungal diseases such as mildew. The \\nleaves of pawpaw ( Carica papaya ) and sweet basil have a general fungicidal effect. Many other plant \\nspecies are known to have fungicidal effec ts. Traditional knowledge might be of help to amend the \\nrange of plant extracts in each region.  \\n \\nFiBL. 2011. African Organic Agriculture Training Manual – Pest, Disease and Weeds.

WEED MANAGEMENT  \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nOrganic farmers give first priority to prevention of the introduction and multiplication  of weeds. The \\nmanagement practices aim  at keeping the weed population at a level that does not result in economic \\nloss of th e crop cultivation or harm its quality. The goal is not to completely eradicate all weeds, as \\nthey also have a role to play on the farm . For example, weeds provide c over that reduces soil erosion. \\nIn addition, most of the biological diversity in our crop f ields comes from the presence of weeds. They \\nprovide habitat for bot h beneficial biocontrol insects and mycorrhiza fungi. Because weeds  offer \\npollen a nd nectar they allow biocontrol insects to maintain their populations and, therefore, serve as a \\nvaluable  instrument in controlling pests.  \\nHowever, weeds may also alter the environment of the crop in a negative way.  Light and air circulation , \\nfor example, are reduced between the crop plants. In this darker and more humid  environment,  \\ndiseases find ideal conditions in which to spread and infect plants.  \\nAs we have seen many times up to this point, a basic working principle i n organic farming is  to \\nprevent problems , rather than to cure them. This applies equally to weed m anagement. Good weed \\nmanagement in organic farming includes creating conditions which hinder weeds fro m growing at the \\nwrong time and in the wrong place and then become a serious  problem for the crop cu ltivation. \\nCompetition by weeds doesn’t harm the crop throughout the whole cultivation period in the sam e way. \\nThe most sensitive phase of a crop to weed competition is in its early growth stage. A young plant i s \\nvulnerable and depe nds highly on an ideal nutrient, light, and water supply for a good development. If \\nit ha s to compete with weeds at this stage, the crop may grow weak, which also makes it more \\nvulnerable to pe st and disease infections.  \\nWeed competition later in the culti vation period is less harmful. However, some weeds may cause \\nharvesting problems and reduce the crop yield in that way. Therefore, weeds should not be completely \\nignored after the most critical growth period of the crop, but in general, they become less im portant.  \\nThese considerations should influence the selection and timing of weed m anagement measures. In \\ngeneral, such measures aim at keeping the weed population at a level which doesn’t  result in economic \\nloss of the crop cultivation or harm its quality.  \\n \\nSeveral preventive measures may be applied at the same  time (Figure 9 -2 & 9-4). The importance and \\neffec tiveness of  the different methods depend to a large extent on the weed species an d the \\nenvironmental conditions. However, some met hods are very effective for a wide range of weeds and \\nare therefore regularly used:  \\n\\uf0b7 Choice of crops and varieties : tall crops and varieties with broader leaves will compete better \\nwith late occurring weeds than small varieties with narrow leaves. Some vari eties will inhibit and \\nsuppress weeds while others will tolerate them. For example, there are witchweed (Striga) \\nresistant maize and cowpea cultivars in many countries of Africa, which give better performance at \\nthe same level of weeds where other varietie s are more affected  (Figure 9 -1). SUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='77 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 9-1 - STRIGA ON A HOST PLAN T WHICH SHOWS SIGNIF ICANT DAMAGES  \\n\\uf0b7 Mulching : the weeds find it difficult to receive enough light to grow and may not be able to pass \\nthroug h the mulch layer. Dry, hardy material, that decomposes slowly, keeps its effect longer than \\nfresh mulch material.  \\n\\uf0b7 Living green cover : The cover competes successfully against the weeds for light, nutrients, and \\nwater and therefore helps to prevent weed gro wth by winning the competition for resources. The \\ncover crops usually used are legumes, which improves soil fertility on top of suppressing weeds . \\nFor example, a ground cover of desmodium ( Desmodium uncinatum ) or silver leaf, inter -seeded \\namong maize, redu ces striga weed and fixes nitrogen at the same time . \\n\\uf0b7 Crop rotation : Rotation of crops is the most efficient measure to regulate seed and root weeds. \\nChanging the conditions of the crop interrupts the living conditions of the weeds thus inhibiting \\ntheir gro wth and spread.  \\n\\uf0b7 Intercropping  (mixed cropping and under -sowing): Intercropping with fast gro wing weed -\\nsuppressive species (“smoother crop” or “ living mulch ”) between rows of main crop species is \\neffective in weed control. There are different examples known  to work in Africa, for example, \\nsowing cowpeas and egusi melons or pumpkins as intercrops in cassava to reduce weed occurrence.  \\n \\nFIGURE 9-2 - CULTURAL PRACTICES OF  MANAGING WEEDS  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='78 \\n \\n \\uf0b7 Sowing time and density : Optimum growing conditions enhance the optimum crop plant \\ndevelopment  and their ability to compete against weeds. Proper crop spacing will ensure that  \\nminimum space is available for the growth of weeds and will minimize competition  with weeds. \\nThis will eff ectively restrict weed development. In order to apply this approach, the limiting weeds \\nmust be known and the seasons in which they occur. A weed calendar of the area or region, if \\navailable, might be of help. It will be used to manage weeds in a targeted fashion with proper timing \\nand effect.  \\n\\uf0b7 Balanced fertilization : it can support an ideal growth of the crop, which promotes the growth of \\nthe crop over the weeds.  \\n\\uf0b7 Soil cultivation methods  can influence the total weed pressure as w ell as the composition of \\nweeds.  For example, minimum -tillag e systems can increase the weed pressure.  Because weed \\nseeds can germinate between soil cultivation and sowing of the crop, weed  cures  before sowing can \\nbe effective at reducing weed pressure.  Use of superficial stubble tre atment works against \\npersisting weeds. It should be done under dry  weather conditions to allow the weed roots which \\nhave been brought to the surface to dry out.  \\n\\uf0b7 Pasturing : in perennial crops like coffee, mangoes, avocadoes or cocoa, the use of sheep  and go ats \\nto reduce rampant weed growth is becoming common. In case of cattle,  broadleaf weeds tend to \\npredominate due to the cattle preference for grasses.  Therefore, it is necessary to rotate with sheep \\nand goats which prefer broadleaves  to overcome this selec tive grazing  (Figure 9 -3). \\n \\nFIGURE 9-3 - PASTURING FOR WEED CO NTROL  \\n\\uf0b7 Prevent dissemination of weeds by eliminating them before seed dispersal.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Prevent insemination of crops by weeds by avoiding the introduct ion of weed seeds into the fields \\nthrough tools or animals; and by using only weed free seed material.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 79}, page_content='79 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 9-4 - HOW TO PREVENT WEEDS  \\n \\nThe soil -borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum  (different isolates from Burkina Faso,  Mali and Niger) is \\nvery effective in reducing the witch weed (Striga hermonthica  and S. asiatica) in different cereal crops, \\nleading t o yield increases in scientific t rials.  Other Fusarium species found in Sudan an d Ghana are \\nvery effective, too (Fusarium nygamai, F. oxysporum and F. solani) . This mycoherbicide is on the way to \\nbeing formulated and registered in different countries in Africa.  \\nRhizobacteria capable of suppressing germination of witch weed ( Striga spp.) seeds or actually \\ndestroying the seeds are particularly promising biological control agents since they can be easily and \\ncheaply formulated into seed inoculants. Pseudomonas fluorescens putida isolates significantly \\ninhibited germination of Striga hermo nthica seeds. However, currently no biocontrol product is \\navailable.  \\n \\nWith the necessary preventive measures, weed density can be reduced, but it will hardly be enough \\nduring the critical periods of the crop at the beginning of cultivatio n. Therefor e, mechanical methods \\nremain an imp ortant part of weed management  (Figure 9 -5).  \\nManual weeding  is probably the most important one. As it’s very labour intensive, reducing weed \\ndensity as much as possible in the field will bring less work later on and should therefore be aimed at. \\nThere are different tools to dig, cut and uprooting the weeds; hand, ox -drawn and tractor -drawn tools. \\nUsing the right tool can increase work efficiency significantly.  \\nWeeding should be done before the weeds flower and produce seeds.  \\nFlame weeding  is another option: Plants are heated briefly to 100°C and hig her. This provokes \\ncoagulation of the proteins in the leaves and a burs ting of their cell walls. Conse quently, the weed dries \\nout and dies.  Although it is an effectiv e method, it is quite expensive, as it consumes  a large amount of \\nfuel gas and needs machinery.

SOIL CULTIVATION AND TILLAGE  \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nSoil cultivation includes all mechanical measures to loosen, turn or mix the s oil, such as ploughing, \\ntilling, digging, hoeing, harrowing etc. Careful soil cultivation can improve the soil‘s capacity to retain \\nwater, its aeration, capacity of infiltration, warming up, evaporation etc. But soil cultivation can also \\nharm the soil fert ility as it accelerates erosion and the decomposition of humus. There is not one right \\nway to cultivate the soil, but a range of options. Depending on the cropping system and the soil type, \\nappropriate soil cultivation patterns must be developed.  \\n \\nThere are many reasons for cultivating the soil. The most important ones are to  (Figure 10 -1): \\n• Loosen the soil to facilitate the penetration of plant roots  \\n• Improve the aeration (nitrogen and oxygen from the air)  \\n• Encourage  the activity of the soil organisms  \\n• Increase infiltration of water  \\n• Reduce evaporation  \\n• Destroy or control weeds and soil pests  \\n• Incorporate crop residues and manures into the soil  \\n• Prepare the site for seeds and seedlings  \\n• Repair soil compaction caused by prev ious activities  \\n \\nFIGURE 10-1 - FACTORS INFLUENCING S OIL FERTILITY  \\n \\nAny soil cultivation activity has a more or less destructive impact on soil structure. In tropical soils, \\nregular tillage  accelerates the decomposition of organic matter which can lead to nutrient losses. The \\nmixing of soil layers can severely harm certain soil organisms. Soil after tillage is very prone to soil \\nerosion if left uncovered before the onset of heavy rains  (Figu re 10 -2). \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='82 \\n \\n Minimum tillage systems on the other side help to build up a natural soil structure with a crumbly top \\nsoil rich in organic matter and full of soil organisms. Nutrient losses are reduced to a minimum as \\nthere is no sudden decomposition of organic  matter and nutrients are caught by a dense network of \\nplant roots. Soil erosion won‘t be a problem as long as there is a permanent plant cover or sufficient \\ninput of organic material. Last but not least, farmers can save a lot of labour  (Figure 10 -3). \\n \\nFIGURE 10-2 - SIGNS FOR SOIL EROSIO N \\n \\nFIGURE 10-3 - HOW TO PREVENT SOIL E ROSION  \\n \\nUpper left: subsoil of low fertility and dark fertile topsoil ; upper right: stones \\nelevated from the soil due to erosion ; bottom left: severe erosion in a new tea \\nplantation; bottom right: Gully erosion in ginger cultivation\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='83 \\n \\n Thus, each organic farmer will have to assess the soil cultivation practice whi ch is most suitable for \\nhis/her conditions. To minimize the negative impacts of soil cultivation while benefiting from its \\nadvantages, the organic farmer should aim on reducing the number of interventions to the minimum \\nand choose methods that conserve the  natural qualities of the soil.  \\n \\nFIGURE 10-4 - ADVANTAGES OF SOIL CU LTIVATION AND ZERO -TILLAGE SYSTEMS  \\n \\nIf soils are cultivated in wet conditions or burdened with heavy machinery, there is a r isk of soil \\ncompaction which results in suppressed root growth, reduced aeration and water logging  (Figure 10 -\\n5). \\nWhere soil compaction is a potential problem, farmers should be aware of the following aspects:  \\n• The risk of soil compaction is highest when th e soil structure is disturbed in wet conditions  \\n• Do not drive vehicles on your land soon after rains  \\n• Ploughing of wet soils can lead to a smearing of the plough sole  \\n• Soils rich in sand are less prone to soil compaction than soils rich in clay  \\n• High content o f soil organic matter reduce the risk of soil compaction  \\n• It is very difficult to restore a good soil structure once soil compaction took place  \\n \\nFIGURE 10-5 - SOIL COMPACTION  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='84 \\n \\n  \\nDependi ng on the aim of the soil cultivation, different cultivation practices are implemented during \\ndifferent stages of the cropping cycle: after harvesting, before sowing or planting or while the crop \\nstands.  \\nIn order to accelerate decomposition, t he residues of the previous crop are incorporated into the soil \\nbefore preparing the seedbed for the next crop. Crop residues, green manure crops and farmyard \\nmanure should be worked only into the topsoil layer (15 to 20 cm), as decomposition in deeper soi l \\nlayers is incomplete, producing growth inhibiting substances which can harm the next crop.  \\nIn annual crops or new plantations, primary tillage is usually done with a plough or a similar \\ninstrument. As a principle, soil cultivation should achieve a flat turning of the top soil and a loosening \\nof the medium deep soil. Deep turning soil cultivation mixes the soil layers, harms soil organisms and \\ndisturbs the natural structure of the soil.  \\nBefore sowing or planting, seconda ry soil cultivation is done to crush and smoothen the ploughed \\nsurface. Seedbed preparation has the purpose to provide enough loose soil of appropriate clod size. If \\nweed pressure is high, seedbeds can be prepared early thus allowing weed seeds to germinat e before \\nthe crop is sown. Shallow soil cultivation after some days is sufficient to eliminate the young weed \\nseedlings. Where water logging is a problem, seedbeds can be established as mounds or ridges.  \\nOnce the crop is established, sh allow soil cultivation (e.g. by hoeing) helps to suppress weeds. It also \\nenhances the aeration of the soil and at the same time reduces the evaporation of soil moisture from \\nthe deeper soil layers. When crops are temporarily lacking nutrients, shallow soil  cultivation can \\nstimulate the decomposition of organic matter, thus making nutrients available.  \\nEXAMPLE : Minimum and zero -tillage in Honduras  (Adapted from: “Manual de agricultura \\nbiológica”,1999.

PLANT PROPAGATIO N  \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE  \\nThe choice of high quality organic seed and plant propagation material of suitable varieties is an \\nimportant key to successful organic farming, allowing for improved yield and product quality, for crop \\nresilience, considerate use  of non -renewable resources and for increased genetic and species diversity.  \\nThis practice describes the principles of plant propagation in organic farming, as well as the \\nimportance of the use of traditional varieties and their conservation.  \\nIdeally , all plant production should be based on organically -bred and organically -propagated varieties. \\nWhere the number of organically bred varieties are very limited or non -existent for certain crops, \\nconventionally bred varieties are allowed, except for varieties de rived from  genetic engineering (GMO \\ncrops, Figure 11 -1), which are  not allowed  in organic farming . However, the seeds of conventionally \\nbred varieties should be propagated under certified organic systems.  \\n \\nFIGURE 11-1 - HOW TO REDUCE THE RIS K OF GMO  CONTAMINATION  \\nIn order to improve the quality of organically propagated seed and plant material and to make the \\npropagation  less risky, training of farmers’ groups that will specialize in this issue is required. T raining \\nis needed in all aspects of propagation: maintenance breeding, avoidance of unwanted cross -\\npollination, seed and plant health, phytosanitary issues of vegetative propagation, cleaning and \\nprocessing of seeds, short and long term storage , as well as  marketing strategies. Seed production \\nshould be combined with on -farm variety testing in order to provide as much information for farmers \\nas possible.  \\n \\nFirst , the kind of propagation needs to be determined: either those based on generati ve propagation or \\nsexual reproduction (seeds) such as lettuce, curly endive, pepper, eggplants, tomato, beans, etc.; or \\nthose vegetative propagated (asexual reproduction) th rough another part of the plant: potato tubers, \\nsweet potato roots, bulbs in onion and garlic, cuttings in artichoke, stolons in strawberry, “ spiders”  or \\nroots in asparagus, etc.  \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='87 \\n \\n  \\nDespite the method of propagation to be used, all the see ds and plant material used shou ld be free of \\npathogens and weeds, and obtained from safe sources. Cert ified seeds are normally clean, but if such \\nseeds are not available to the farmers, the seeds should be treated before use to eliminate seed -borne \\ndiseases ( with a hot water treatment  for example, Figure 11 -2).The health of the seeds  (while storage \\nperiod) , seedlings, cuttings or other plant material used is crucial for preventing pests and diseases, \\nand to keep crop productivity  (Figure 11 -3). \\n \\nFIGURE 11-2 - HOT WATER TREATMENTS FOR SEEDS  \\n \\nFIGURE 11-3 - PREVENTIVE MEASURES  AGAINST STORAGE PEST S AND DISEASES  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='88 \\n \\n In the following sections, the considerations for seed evaluation, characterization and multiplication \\nwill be discussed in details.  \\n \\nFarmers select seeds with specific characteristics to meet their particular needs: yield; quality like \\ncolour, texture, flavour; adaptation to climate oscillations; resistance to pests and diseases; fodder \\nvalue; soil enrichment by nitrogen fixation or extensive root system; among others (Shiva et al.  2004).  \\nGood quality seed is the sum of its genetic, physiological, physical and health traits. Concerning \\ngenetic quality , the material should be of known origin, alr eady tested in the region, and produced in \\nan isolated environment (separated from other varieties to prevent intercrossing). The seeds can be \\nbred by a plant breeder of by a farmer. When a farmer wants to select his own genetic material, he has \\nto bear ma ny details in mind:  \\n\\uf0b7 Choose the best plants on the farm: vigorous growth, high yielding plants, good quality fruits \\n(shape, colour and flavour (when applicable)), best fruit covering, good health, etc.  \\n\\uf0b7 The selected plants should be looked after with the utm ost care . \\n\\uf0b7 Every plant not corresponding to the chosen type should be eliminated, and is olation distance \\nstrictly  respected.  \\n\\uf0b7 Neighbouring  plants having pest or diseases must be eliminated.  \\n\\uf0b7 Fruits must be picked at optimum maturity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Once picked, the seeds sh ould be taken out at once.  \\n\\uf0b7 For storage, the procedure will depend on the plant family:  \\n\\uf0e0In case of fresh tomato cultivars for example, the juice, seeds and placenta should be put in a \\nglass  jar for fermentation for 24 to 48 hours fermentation, depending on  ambient temperature, \\nto prevent bacterial cancrosis  problems transmitted by seeds. If the seeds get pressed together, \\nthe lumps should be taken apart  by hand. The seeds is then stored in brown paper bags, with \\ndiatomaceous earth or wood ashes. In the latt er case, the ratio is 50% seeds and 50% ash.  \\n\\uf0e0When storage  of grain such rice  is needed , the best strategy is to sundry  the seeds before \\nstorage ; sun dry should be carried -out at low air moisture. Before storage the grains should be \\nsoaked in neem oil,  as this helps keep away storage pests.  \\nPhysical  quality  comes from physical botanical purity . In this context, the farmers must keep in \\nmind that:  \\n\\uf0b7 Only pure seed of the selected species should be kept, free from foreign seeds. Great care must \\nbe taken while p icking lettuce, onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, to keep out weeds \\nwith seeds, because separation later is very difficult.  \\n\\uf0b7 It should include the smallest possible amount of inert material (remains of flowers, fruits, etc.)  \\n\\uf0b7 It should have goo d weight and size, without mechanical damage (e.g. wild radish seeds are \\nvery sensitive, their seed cuticle being very brittle during the seed cleaning process).  \\nHealth quality  should be achieved by working -up a healthy, organic soil, rich in organic matte r, \\nnutrients and microorganisms, so that plants grow healthy and without nutrient or physiological \\nimbalances that make them susceptible  to pests and diseases.  Strict control of unhealthy plants should \\nbe established, so as not foster  foci of infection and  sources of inoculation brought  from plant by insect \\nvectors.  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content='89 \\n \\n  \\n\\uf0b7 Traditional seeds are locally available because farmers collect good seeds from their own plots \\nand keep them for the next season.  \\n\\uf0b7 Farmers  either buy or exchange their seed with other farmers or grow their own seeds. \\nTherefore the cost of seeds is minimal.  \\n\\uf0b7 Native seeds are geared to a subsistence economy as the farmers first grow food for his \\nsubsistence and/or stock seed for the next season  and market only the surplus.  \\n\\uf0b7 Native seeds embody indigenous knowledge. A farmer who uses native seeds use his /her  \\ntraditional knowledge, skills and wisdom to grow them, promoting self -reliance.  \\n\\uf0b7 An outstanding feature of native seeds is diversity.  \\n\\uf0b7 Native s eeds are hardy, as they have, over the years, developed resistance to the pests a nd \\ndiseases.  \\n\\uf0b7 Traditional seeds have high level of tolerance to conditions of stress and are adapted to local \\nagro -climatic  conditions.  \\n \\nFarming communities h ave always implemented conservation methods known to the formal sector  as \\nex-situ (off-field) and in-situ (in-field) conservation strategies. In-situ conservation provides farmers a \\nvaluable option for conserving crop biodiversity and helps to sustain evol utionary systems that are \\nresponsible for the generation of genetic variability. This is especially significant in many parts of the \\nworld subject to drought and other stresses, because it is under such environmental extremes that \\nvariations useful for str ess-resistance breeding are generated. In the case of diseases or pests, this \\nallows for continuing host -parasite co -evolution.  \\nAlso under the se conditions, access to a wide diversity of local seeds probably provides the only \\nreliable  source of planting ma terial. The ability of such material  to survive under to survive under \\nthese stresses is conditioned by the ir inherent broad genetic base.  \\nThe seed system used in most traditional farming systems is based on the local production of seeds \\nby the farmers  themselves. Farmers consistently retain seed as security measure to provide back -up \\nin case of crop failure.  \\nFarmers practice seed selection, production and saving for informal distribution of planting material \\nwithin and among the farming communities. Commu nity seed bank  represents one strategy for a \\ncollective maintenance of genetic diversity in crops/plant species. Low -cost community level seed \\nbank or seed storage facilities can help to preserve climate mitigating characteristics of traditional \\nvarieties,  while, at the same time, serving as a base material for farmers to select special lines to meet \\ntheir changing needs. They also play a role in improving market outlets through enabling communities \\nto produce crop of known quality and in stabilizing prices  over changing situations. Thus, community \\nseed bank development contributes toward promoting ec onomic empowerment of farmers.  \\nLikewise, the establishment of species adapted to extreme environments in field gene banks  at \\nstrategic sites can provide a reser ve for places where traditional crops may have completely failed. \\nGerm -plasm materials maintained in such fields  could be distributed to rural farming communities or \\nfor further investigation of their potential use in breeding programs to improve food secu rity.  \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='90 \\n \\n FAO. 2011.

ANIMAL HUSBANDRY   \\nIN ORGANIC AGRICULTUR E  \\nIntegrating animal husbandry into crop producing farms is one of the principles of organic farming. In \\ntemperate and arid zones, animal husbandry plays an important role in the recycling of nutrients, \\nwhile it is less emphasised in the humid tropics. Th e caring, training, and nurturing of animals is \\nconsidered an art in many farming communities.  \\nIntegrating animals into a farm help creating a closed or semi -closed system where energy and \\nnutrients are recycled  (Figure 12 -1). Animals can convert non -edibl e biomass (e.g. grass, straw, \\nkitchen waste) into food, while increasing soil fertility with their manure.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-1 - ANIMALS INTEGRATED IN TO THE FARM , SHOWING THE FLOW OF FODDER , DUNG AND PRODUCTS  \\nMany  farm animals have a multi -functional role, for example  (Figure 12 -2): \\n→ Produce dung which is of great importance for soil fertility.  \\n→ Yield products such as milk or eggs for sale or own consumption continuously.  \\n→ Recycle by -products such as straw or kitchen waste.  \\n→ Serve as draught animals for tillage or transport.  \\n→ Produce meat, hides, feathers, horns etc.  \\n→ Serve as an investment or a bank.  \\n→ Help in pest control (e.g. dugs) and weed management (e.g. grazing on barren fields).  \\n→ Have cultural or religious significa nce (prestige, ceremonies etc.).  \\n→ Produce young stock for breeding or sale.  \\nSUMMARY  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='92 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 12-2 - REASONS TO KEEP FARM ANIMALS - A COW IS NOT JUST A CO W! FARM ANIMALS CAN HAVE  MANY FUNCTIONS FOR A  FARMER  \\nThe signifi cance of each role will vary from animal to animal and from farm to farm. It will also depend \\non the individual objectives of the farmer.  \\n \\nThere are several reasons for taking up animal husbandry as a part of your farmi ng activities or even \\nas the main one. There are also a number of critical aspects to be taken into consideration. In order to \\nmake a decision on whether and how to get involved in animal husbandry, you should ask yourself a \\nnumber of questions:  \\nDo I have sufficient space for shedding and grazing, sufficient fodder or by -products to feed, sufficient \\nknow -how on keeping, feeding, and treating the specific kind of animals?  \\nCan I use the dung in a suitable  way? Will I get products for my own consumption or sales? Will the \\nanimals somehow affect my crops?  \\nIs sufficient labour available within or outside my farm? Is enough fodder and water of good quality \\navailable throughout t he year? Will remedies and veterinary support be available, if needed? Can I get \\nsuitable breeds of animals?  \\nDoes anyone want to buy my milk, eggs, meat etc.? Is the price worth the effort? Am I able to compete \\nwith o ther farmers?  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='93 \\n \\n Organic farmers try to achieve healthy farm animals which can produce satisfyingly over a long period \\nof time  (Figure 12 -3). To achieve this goal, various needs of farm animals have to be considered:  \\n→ Fodder in adequate quality and quantity; for non -ruminants: diversity in fodder is usually \\nrequired.  \\n→ Sufficient access to clean drinking water.  \\n→ Clean sheds of sufficient size and with adequate light and fresh air.  \\n→ Sufficient freedom to move around and perform their natural b ehaviour.  \\n→ Healthy conditions and veterinary follow -up, when needed.  \\n→ Sufficient contact with other animals, but no stress due to overcrowding.  \\n→ For herd animals: an appropriate age and sex distribution within the herd.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-3 - WHAT FARM ANIMALS NEE D - FOR EXAMPLE CHICKENS HAVE VARIOUS NEEDS W HICH SHOULD BE FULFI LLED SIMULTANEOUSLY  \\nOrganic animal husbandry means not only feeding organic food and avoiding synthetic food additives \\nand synthetic medicines (e .g. antibiotics, grow hormones), but also focusing on satisfying the various \\nneeds of the farm animals. Good health and welfare of the animals are among the main objectives. \\nSuffering due to mutilations, permanent tethering or isolation of herd animals mus t be avoided as \\nmuch as possible. For various reasons, landless animal husbandry (i.e. fodder purchased from outside \\nthe farm, no grazing land) is not permitted in organic farming.  \\nIn order to identify the appropriate number for a  specific kind of animal on a farm, the followi ng points \\nshould be considered:  \\n→ Availability of fodder on the farm, especially in periods of scarcity (e.g. dry season).  \\n→ Carrying capacity of pastures.  \\n→ Size of existing or planned sheds.  \\n→ Maximum amount of manu re the fields can bear.  \\n→ Availability of labour for looking after the animals.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content='94 \\n \\n In tropical countries, farm animals are frequently found to be underfed. When defining the number of \\nfarm animals, keep in mind that the economic  benefit will be higher when few er animals are kept, but \\nfed well. Not only the amount, but also the quality of the available food mu st be taken into \\nconsideration.  \\n \\nThe type of shed should be specific to the type of animals to be sheltered. Poultry, for instance, should \\nbe housed in sheds that do not get too hot. Contact of the animals with their faeces should be avoided \\nas much as possible.  \\nWith the exception of nomadic lifestyles, most farm animals are temporarily kept in sheds. The \\ncombination of animal hu sbandry and farm activities requires control of their movements so as to \\navoid damage to crops. For the welfare and health of the animals, sheds must be cool and aerated, and \\nprotect from rain  (Figure 12 -4). \\nThey should be  constructed in a way ensuring:  \\n→ Sufficient space to lie down, stand up, move and express natural behaviour (e.g. licking, \\nscratching etc.).  \\n→ Sufficient light (as a rule, one should be able to read a newspaper in the shed).  \\n→ Protection from sunlight, rain, and extreme temperatures.  \\n→ Sufficient  aeration, but no draught.  \\n→ Appropriate beddings (see section below).  \\n→ Elements to exercise natural behaviour (e.g. for poultry: perching rails, sand baths and \\nsecluded laying nests).  \\n→ Sheltered pits or heaps to collect and store manure.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-4 - TRADITIONAL SIMPLE SH EDS IN SENEGAL (CATTLE SHED , GOAT SHED , CHICKEN SHED ) \\nFor economic reasons, sheds can be built with simple, locally available materials. Many countries have \\na rich tradition of shed constructi ons, and have developed the most efficient and appropriate shed \\nsystems for the conditions of the region. If techniques of this heritage are combined with the above \\nprinciples, a locally adapted and at the same time animal friendly system may be obtained.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='95 \\n \\n Beddings are materials used in sheds for keeping the floor soft, dry, and clean, which is important for \\nanimal health. They absorb the excrements of the animals and need to be re -placed from time to time. \\nBeddings can be of straw, leaves, twigs, h usks or other locally available material. They can be replaced \\ndaily or kept for several months while adding fresh materia l on top.  \\n \\nThe availability of fodder is one of the limiting factors in animal husbandry. Unlike landless systems in \\nconventional farming, organic husbandry should be mainly based on the fodder produced on the farm \\nitself. As is the case with humans, there is a direct link between the quantity and composition of the \\nfood and th e health status of the animals.  \\nIf farm animals are to be productive (milk, eggs, meat etc.), it is important that they get suitable food in \\nsufficient quantities. If the fodder production of one‘s farm is limited (which usually is the case), it \\nmight be economically valid to keep less animals but sup ply them with sufficient food (Figure 12 -5).  \\nThe appropriate quantity and the mix of feed items will of course depend on the type of animal, but \\nalso on its main use (e.g. chicken for meat or egg production, cattle for milk, me at or draft etc.). In milk \\nproduction for example, cows producing milk should be given fresh grass and possibly other feed \\nitems of sufficient protein content. On the same diet, draught animals would rapidly become exhausted.  \\nA balanced diet will keep an a nimal healthy and productive. Whether or not a farm animal receives the \\nappropriate amount and kind of fodder usually can be seen by the shine of its hair or feathers. For \\nruminants, a majority of the fodder should consist of roughage (grass, leaves). If c oncentrates or \\nsupplements are used (e.g. agricultural by -products and wastes), they should not contain growth \\npromoters and other synthetic substances. Instead of buying expensive concentrates, there are a \\nvariety of leguminous plants rich in protein whic h can be grown in the farm as cover crop, hedges or \\ntrees. If mineral content in the available fodder is not sufficient to satisfy the animal‘s requirements, \\nmineral salt bricks or similar feed supplements can be used as long as they do not contain synthet ic \\nadditives.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-5 - VARIETIES OF FODDER G RASSES AND LEGUMINOU S TREE PLANTS USED A S FODDER FOR CATTLE AND GOATS  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 96}, page_content='96 \\n \\n  \\nIn many regions of the tropics, favourable periods with ab undant fodder alternate with less favourable \\nperiods when there is almost nothing to feed to the animals. However, keeping animals means \\nproviding fodder throughout the year. Fodder can be produced on the farm as grazing land or as grass \\nor tree crops used  for cutting.  \\nWhile grazing requires less labour than shed feeding, more land is needed and appropriate measures \\nto keep the animals away from other crops must be undertaken. Grazing may lead to a lower \\nproductivity (milk, meat) but usually is the more fav ourable option concerning heal th and welfare of \\nthe animals  (Figure 12 -6).  \\nShed keeping, however, has the advantage that the dung can be easily collected, stored, or composted \\nand applied to the crops. Whether grazing or shed feeding is the more suitable option will mainly \\ndepend on the agro -climatic conditions, the cropping system, and the availability of land. A \\ncombination of shed feeding and grazing in a fenced area may be an ideal combination of high \\nproductivity and animal friendly husbandry. In exte nsive grass lands of semi -arid areas, however, \\ngrazing may be the only suitable option.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-6 - THE PROS AND CONS OF GRAZING AND SHED FEE DING , AND THE COMBINATION OF BOTH SYSTEMS AS A  PROMISING OPTIO N \\nIn most smallholder farms, fodder cultivation will compete for space with the cultivation of crops. \\nWhether fodder cultivation (and thus animal husbandry) is economically more beneficial compared \\nwith crop produ ction must be assessed case by case. However, there are some options for integrating \\nfodder crops in farms without sacrificing much  land. Below are some examples:  \\n→ Grass or leguminous cover crops in tree plantations  \\n→ Hedges of suitable shrubs  \\n→ Shade or suppor t trees  \\n→ Grass on bunds against soil erosion  \\n→ Grass fallows or green manures in the crop rotation  \\n→ Crops with by -products such as paddy straw or pea leaves  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='97 \\n \\n The management of pastures is crucial for a good herd management. It is also imp ortant to practice \\nappropriate management throughout the year. There are many different types of grasses, and every \\nclimatic region has grasses which are specifically adapted to the conditions. In some cases it may be \\nworth considering to till the grazing site and sow grass varieties that are more app ropriate to the \\nanimal‘s needs.  \\nOvergrazing is probably the most significant threat to grass land. Once the protective grass cover is \\ndestroyed, the top soil is prone to erosion. Degraded pastures or land with little plant cover is difficult \\nto re -cultivate. Therefore, it is important that the use and intensity of grazing on a particular piece of \\nland is appropriate to its production capacity. Sufficient time must be given to a pasture to re cover \\nafter intensive  grazing.  \\nFencing off of areas and rotation of the grazing animals on several pieces of land is the best option for \\nmanaging the farm and the overall landscape. Creating “grazing cells” restores overgrazed pastures, \\nreduce the incidence of intestinal para sites encountered while the animals graze, and increase land \\nproductivity.  The intensity and timing of grazing, as well as the cutting of the grass , will influence the \\nvarieties of plants growing in the pasture  (Figure 12 -7).  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-7 - CATTLE GRAZING ON A P ASTURE IN CUBA \\n \\nDisease causing germs and parasites are present almost everywhere. Like humans, animals have an \\nimmune system which is usually able to cope with these germs. And as with humans, the efficiency of \\nthe immune system will be disturbed if animals are not properly fed, cannot practise their natural \\nbehaviour, or are under social stress.  \\nHealth is a balance between disease pressure (the presence of germs and parasites) and the r esistance \\n(immune system and self -healing forces) of the animal. The farmer can influence both sides of this \\nbalance: reduce the quantity of germs by maintaining good hygiene, and strengthen the animal‘s \\nability to cope with germs  (Figure 12 -8). \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 98}, page_content='98 \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 12-8 - BACTERIA , VIRUSES AND PARASITE S ATTACKING THE FARM  ANIMAL WHICH FIGHTS BACK WITH ITS IMMUNE  SYSTEM .  \\nTHE FARMER CAN INFLUE NCE BOTH SIDES OF TH IS BALANCE  \\nOrganic animal husbandry puts its focus on improv ing the living conditions of animals and on \\nstrengthening their immune systems. Of course: if an animal gets sick it must be treated. But the \\nfarmer should also think about why the immune system of the animal was not able to fight the disease \\nor the parasi te attack. And the farmer should think of ways to improve the animals living conditions \\nand hygiene in order to strengthen it.  \\nSimilar as in crop health, organic animal husbandry puts the main emphasis on preventive measures in \\norder to keep animals healthy, rather than on curative methods. This starts from keeping robust \\nbreeds rather than high performing but very susceptible ones. Next, the conditions in which the \\nanimals are kept should be optimal ones: sufficient space, light an d air, dry and clean bedding, \\nfrequent exercise (e.g. grazing) and proper hygiene.  \\nThe quality and quantity of fodder is of crucial importance for the health of the animal.  Instead of \\nfeeding commercial concentrates which make animals grow faster and pro duce more, a natural diet \\nappropriate to the requirements of the animal should be achieved. Where all these preventive \\nmeasures are taken, animals will rarely fall sick. Veterinary treatment thus should play only a \\nsecondary role in organic farming. If tre atment is necessary, alternative medicine based on herbal and \\ntraditional remedies should be used. Only if these treatments fail or are not sufficient, synthetic \\nmedicines (e.g. antibiotics, parasiticides, anaesthetics) may be used; in these cases, the tre ated animals \\nmust be separated from non -treated organic stock and excluded for a period of time (e.g. at least 3 \\nweeks) from organic certification..  \\nThe main principal for veterinary treatment in organic animal husbandry is: get to know the causes of \\n(or f actors that favour) diseases in order to enhance the natural defence mechanisms of the animal \\n(and to prevent its manifestations in the future).  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='99 \\n \\n  \\nUnlike in crop production, synthetic means are allowed to cure sick animals if alternative treatment is \\nnot su fficient. Here, reducing the suffering of the animal is given priority over the renunciation of \\nchemicals. However, the standards of organic agriculture clearly demand that priority is given to \\nmanagement practices which encourage the resistance of the ani mals thus preventing the outbreak of \\na disease. Therefore, an outbreak of a disease shall be considered as an indicator that the conditions \\nunder which the animal is kept are not ideal. The farmer should try to identify the cause (or causes) of \\nthe disease  and prevent future outbreaks by  changing management practices (Figure 12 -9). \\nIf conventional veterinary medication is applied, withholding periods must be adhered to before the \\nanimal products can be sold as “organic” . This shall ensure that organic anima l products are free from \\nresidues of antibiotics etc. Synthetic growth promoters are not allowed in any case.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-9 - PREVENTION BEFORE CUR ING -  \\nONLY WHEN ALL PREVENT IVE MEASURES FAIL AN IMALS SHOULD BE TREATED , PREFERABLY WITH ALTE RNATIVE REMEDIES  \\nHerbal medicines are widely used in many countries. Some traditional farming communities have a \\nvast knowledge of local plants and their healing properties. Plants can definitely support the healing \\nprocess, even if they do not eliminate the germ of the disease directly. Still, farmers should not forget \\nto identify the cause of the disease and also to re -think their management practises. For parasite \\nproblems, changi ng the living conditions or the management of pastures will be more effective in t he \\nlong run than any treatment.  \\nExample: Using Sweet Flag against parasites  (Figure 12 -10) \\nOne example to use an herbal remedy against parasites is sweet flag ( Acorus calamus ). This plant \\ngrows both in tropical as well as subtropical regions and is found on the banks of rivers and lakes and \\nin swampy ditches or marshes. The powdered dried rhizomes (thick root parts) act as an effective \\ninsecticide against fowl lice, fleas and house flies.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='100  \\n \\n  \\nFIGURE 12-10 - USING SWEET FLAG AGAI NST PARASITES  \\nTreating fowls infested by lice: Use around 15  g of powdered rhizome for an adult bird. For dusting the \\nbird with the powder, hold it by its fe et upside down so that the feathers open and the dust will work \\nits way to the skin. The treatment is reported as being safe to the birds. The sweet flag powder is also \\nreported to be effective against house flies when dusted on fresh cow dung infested by fly maggots. It \\nfurther shall protect new -born calves of vermin infection if washed with a water infusion.  \\nAttention!  Herbal remedies against parasites can also have a toxic effect on the farm animals! \\nTherefore it is important to know the appropria te dose  and application method!  \\nAs preventive measures for maintaining good animal health are of high relevance in organic farming, \\nthe selection of breeds suitable to local conditions and to organic feeding is of crucial importance. This \\nrequires that suitable breeds are available. Traditional breeds of farm animals may be a good starting \\npoint for organic animal breeding. Animals can be improved by selection of individuals especially \\nsuitable for organic conditions. They can be crossbred w ith suitable new breeds, thus achieving an \\nanimal with the positive aspects of traditional breeds and the satisfying production of the new breeds.  \\nFor breeding, organic farming uses natural reproduction techniques. While artificial insemination is \\nallowed,  embryo transfer, genetic manipulation, and hormonal synchro nisation are not permitted \\naccording to IFOAM standards.  \\n \\nOver the last decades, traditional breeds have been replaced by high performing ones in many regions. \\nSimilar to high yieldi ng plant varieties, these new breeds usually depend on a rich diet (concentrates) \\nand optimal living conditions. As high performing breeds in general are more susceptible to diseases \\nthan traditional varieties, they need frequent veterinary interventions. Thus, these new breeds might \\nnot be the right choice for small farmers, as the costs of food concentrates and veterinary treatment \\nare too high compared with what can be earned by selling the products.  \\nIn addition, for organic farmers the main animal prod uct (e.g. milk) is not the only reason to keep \\nanimals. Breeding activities therefore should try to optimise the overall performance of the animal, \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'BestPractices.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content='101  \\n \\n taking into consideration the different goals of an organic farmer. For example a poultry breed suitable \\nfor organic smallholder farms might not be the one with the highest egg production, but one in which \\nmeat production is good, and kitchen wastes and whatever is found on the farm yard can be used as \\nfeed. Suitable cattle breeds would produce sufficient milk a nd meat while feeding mainly on roughage \\nand farm by -products (e.g. straw), be of high fertility and good resistance against diseases, if required, \\nthey can also be used for draught and transport.  \\n \\nFIGURE 12-11 - BREEDING GOALS  \\nWhen comparing the production of different breeds of cows, usually, only the production per day or \\nyear is taken into consideration. However, high performing breeds usually have a shorter life sp an \\nthan traditional ones with lower production. The life milk production of a cow giving, for example, 8 \\nlitres per day, but over 10 years, therefore would be greater than the one of a high -breed cow yielding \\n16 litres per day, but dies after 4 years.  \\nAs t he investments to get a milk producing cow are quite high, i.e. the rearing and feeding of a calf or \\nthe purchase of an adult cow, continuous production over a long life span should be of high interest to \\nthe farmer. This should be reflected in the breedin g goals, which so far mainly focus on the maximum \\nshort term production.
